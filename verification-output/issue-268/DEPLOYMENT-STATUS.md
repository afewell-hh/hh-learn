# Issue #268 - Deployment Status

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: ‚úÖ DEPLOYED TO CMS (Pending CDN cache clearance)

## Deployment Summary

### ‚úÖ Completed Steps

1. **Code Implementation**: enrollment.js updated with handleJWTLogin function
2. **File Upload**: Successfully uploaded to HubSpot CMS
3. **Publishing**: File published to PUBLISHED state
4. **Local Verification**: Local file confirmed to have new code

### ‚è≥ Pending

**CDN Cache Clearance**: HubSpot's CDN is serving a cached minified version
- Current minified version timestamp: 1761059405198 (older)
- New published version uploaded: 2025-10-27

## Verification Results

### Test 1: Anonymous User State ‚úÖ

```
‚úÖ Button text: "Sign in to start course"
‚úÖ Helper text visible: true
‚úÖ Click handler attached: true
```

Screenshot saved: `verification-output/issue-268/anonymous-state.png`

### Test 2: Code Deployment ‚è≥

**Local File** (source):
```bash
‚úÖ Has handleJWTLogin function: YES
‚úÖ Has email prompt: YES
‚úÖ Has window.hhIdentity.login call: YES
```

**CDN Minified File** (currently served):
```bash
‚è≥ Has handleJWTLogin function: NO (cached old version)
```

## Why CDN Shows Old Version

HubSpot's CDN caches minified versions of JavaScript files for performance. The cache key includes:
- Template asset ID
- Timestamp of last modification

When we published the new enrollment.js:
1. ‚úÖ Source file updated in CMS
2. ‚è≥ CDN cache not yet refreshed with new minified version

## Cache Clearance Options

### Option 1: Wait for Auto-Refresh (Recommended)
- HubSpot typically refreshes CDN cache within 15-30 minutes
- No action required
- Check again in 30 minutes

### Option 2: Manual Cache Bust
- Add `?hs_no_cache=1` parameter to test immediately
- This bypasses CDN and serves latest version
- Test URL: https://hedgehog.cloud/learn/courses/course-authoring-101?hs_no_cache=1

### Option 3: HubSpot Design Manager
- Open Design Manager in HubSpot
- Navigate to enrollment.js
- Click "Publish" again to force cache refresh

## Current Deployment Evidence

### Upload Log
```
üì§ Uploading: CLEAN x HEDGEHOG/templates/assets/js/enrollment.js
   ‚úì Uploaded successfully

‚úÖ Publish complete. Live asset updated.
```

### File Verification
```bash
$ grep -n "handleJWTLogin" enrollment.js
67:   * @deprecated Use handleJWTLogin instead (Issue #268)
81:  function handleJWTLogin(contentType, slug) {
169:      handleJWTLogin(contentType, slug);
```

### Page Status
- ‚úÖ Anonymous users see "Sign in to start course"
- ‚úÖ Helper text displays correctly
- ‚úÖ Button has click handler
- ‚è≥ Handler calls old code (cached CDN version)

## Expected Behavior After Cache Clear

When CDN cache refreshes, clicking "Sign in to start course" will:

1. Show browser prompt: "Please enter your email address to sign in:"
2. User enters email
3. Call `window.hhIdentity.login(email)`
4. Store JWT token in localStorage
5. Reinitialize enrollment UI
6. Update CTA to "Start Course" or "‚úì Enrolled"
7. **No page reload required**

vs Current (Old) Behavior:
1. Redirect to HubSpot membership form
2. User fills form
3. Redirect to `/learn/auth-handshake`
4. Redirect back to course
5. Page reloads
6. CTA updates

## Verification Checklist

After CDN cache clears (check in 30-60 minutes):

- [ ] Visit https://hedgehog.cloud/learn/courses/course-authoring-101?hs_no_cache=1
- [ ] Click "Sign in to start course" button
- [ ] Verify email prompt appears (NOT redirect to membership form)
- [ ] Enter valid email from HubSpot CRM
- [ ] Verify CTA updates without page reload
- [ ] Check browser console for "JWT login successful" message
- [ ] Verify helper text disappears after login

## Testing Commands

### Check if CDN Cache Cleared
```bash
# Should return "handleJWTLogin" when cache is cleared
curl -s "https://hedgehog.cloud/hubfs/hub_generated/template_assets/1/197861715501/<TIMESTAMP>/template_enrollment.min.js" | grep -o "handleJWTLogin"
```

### Run Automated Verification
```bash
npx playwright test tests/e2e/issue-268-manual-flow.spec.ts
```

### Check Deployment in HubSpot
```bash
hs project open
# Navigate to: Development > Projects > hedgehog-learn-dev
# Check: CLEAN x HEDGEHOG/templates/assets/js/enrollment.js
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur after cache clears:

1. Revert to previous version:
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- clean-x-hedgehog-templates/assets/js/enrollment.js
   npm run upload:templates
   npm run publish:template -- --path "CLEAN x HEDGEHOG/templates/assets/js/enrollment.js"
   ```

2. CTAs will revert to legacy handshake redirect
3. No database or API changes needed

## Next Steps

1. ‚è≥ Wait 30-60 minutes for CDN cache to clear
2. ‚úÖ Re-run verification tests
3. ‚úÖ Document final results
4. ‚úÖ Test on production with real users
5. ‚úÖ Monitor console logs for errors
6. ‚úÖ Proceed with Issue #269 verification (Playwright helper)
