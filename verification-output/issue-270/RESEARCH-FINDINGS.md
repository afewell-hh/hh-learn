# Research Findings: HubSpot Authentication Best Practices

**Issue:** #270 - Simplify CTA login and drop auth-handshake
**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Research Scope:** HubSpot's official authentication patterns and best practices

---

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive research of HubSpot's official documentation, developer resources, and community implementations confirms that **Issue #270's proposed approach is correct and aligns with HubSpot's "golden path"**.

**Key Finding:** HubSpot's native Memberships feature is the recommended pattern for public pages with authenticated features. Custom JWT authentication is NOT needed for this use case.

---

## Critical Discoveries

### 1. HubSpot Deprecated JWT SSO (February 2025)
On **February 5, 2025**, HubSpot officially sunset JWT-based SSO for private content, replacing it with OpenID Connect (OIDC).

**Source:** https://developers.hubspot.com/changelog/sunset-of-jwt-sso-setup-for-private-content

**Implication:** JWT is not HubSpot's preferred authentication pattern going forward.

### 2. request_contact.is_logged_in Works on Public Pages
The HubL variable `request_contact.is_logged_in` is available on **ALL pages** (public and private) during server-side template rendering.

**Source:** https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/cms/data/memberships

**Implication:** The original assumption that "HubSpot authentication doesn't work on public pages" is **incorrect**.

### 3. The Membership API 404 is a Red Herring
While the client-side API endpoint `/_hcms/api/membership/v1/profile` returns 404 on public pages (for security reasons), this does NOT prevent authentication.

**Why:** Authentication state is available via HubL variables during server-side rendering, not client-side API calls.

**Implication:** We don't need custom JWT to solve the "public page authentication problem" because there is no problem.

### 4. Commercial LMS Platforms Use HubSpot Native Auth
Research of commercial learning management systems built on HubSpot CMS (HubLMS, Learn LMS) shows:
- **All use HubSpot's native Memberships** for authentication
- **None use custom JWT** for user-facing login flows
- **All track progress in HubSpot CRM** custom properties

**Implication:** Industry best practice is to use HubSpot's native features.

## Comparison: Custom JWT vs HubSpot Native

| Feature | Current JWT | HubSpot Memberships | Winner |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|---------|
| Works on public pages | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Tie |
| Requires custom code | ❌ Yes (complex) | ✅ No (config) | Native |
| Security maintenance | ❌ Your responsibility | ✅ HubSpot manages | Native |
| SSO support | ❌ No | ✅ SAML + OIDC | Native |
| Social login | ❌ No | ✅ Google, Facebook | Native |
| Passwordless auth | ❌ No | ✅ Magic links | Native |
| Two-factor auth | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Native |
| Password resets | ❌ No | ✅ Automatic | Native |
| Auto logout | Manual | ✅ 20m/40m/60m/24h | Native |
| Session storage | localStorage (less secure) | HTTP-only cookies | Native |
| CSRF protection | Manual | ✅ Built-in | Native |
| Rate limiting | Manual | ✅ Built-in | Native |
| Aligned with HubSpot | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Native |
| Future-proof | ❌ (JWT deprecated) | ✅ (Active development) | Native |

**Result:** HubSpot native authentication is superior in every way except testing automation.

## When Custom Authentication IS Appropriate

According to HubSpot documentation and community best practices:

### Valid Scenarios
1. **External Identity Provider** - Corporate SSO beyond SAML/OIDC
2. **Mobile Applications** - Native apps requiring token-based API access
3. **Headless CMS** - UI hosted on different domain/platform
4. **Test Automation** - Programmatic authentication for CI/CD (internal only)

### This Project's Reality
- ❌ Not external IdP (contacts in HubSpot CRM)
- ❌ Not mobile app (web-based platform)
- ❌ Not headless (hosted on HubSpot CMS)
- ✅ Testing automation needed (valid use case for JWT, but internal only)

**Conclusion:** Custom JWT is justified for **testing only**, not production authentication.

## Recommended Implementation (Issue #270 Alignment)

### Phase 1: User-Facing Authentication
**Use HubSpot's native Memberships feature exclusively**

#### Login Flow
```hubl
{# HubL Template #}
{% if request_contact.is_logged_in %}
  {# Authenticated user #}
  <button onclick="enrollInCourse()">Start Course</button>
  <a href="/learn/my-learning">My Dashboard</a>
{% else %}
  {# Anonymous user #}
  <a href="/_hcms/mem/login?redirect_url={{ request.path }}" class="cta">
    Sign in to start course
  </a>
{% endif %}
```

#### Shared Login Helper
```javascript
// Shared by left-nav and CTA components
function buildLoginUrl(redirectPath = null) {
  const path = redirectPath || window.location.pathname;
  return `/_hcms/mem/login?redirect_url=${encodeURIComponent(path)}`;
}
```

#### Authentication State
```hubl
{# Pass contact data to client via data attributes #}
<body {% if request_contact.is_logged_in %}
        data-authenticated="true"
        data-contact-email="{{ request_contact.email }}"
        data-contact-id="{{ request_contact.hs_object_id }}"
      {% endif %}>
```

### Phase 2: Backend Validation
**Continue using custom endpoints, but validate via HubSpot session**

Options:
1. **Migrate to HubSpot Serverless Functions** (long-term)
   - Access `context.contact` for authenticated user data
   - Native integration with HubSpot session

2. **Keep AWS Lambda** (short-term)
   - Validate HubSpot session cookie
   - Call HubSpot API to verify session
   - Extract contact ID from session

### Phase 3: Testing
**Keep JWT for automated tests only**

```javascript
// For Playwright tests ONLY (not production)
async function authenticateForTesting(page, email) {
  const response = await page.request.post(`${API_BASE_URL}/auth/login`, {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    data: { email }
  });
  const { token } = await response.json();
  await page.evaluate((token) => {
    localStorage.setItem('hhl_auth_token', token);
  }, token);
}
```

**Important:** Gate this endpoint behind environment check (test/dev only, not production).

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. Alignment with HubSpot
- Follows official "golden path" pattern
- Uses documented, supported features
- Future-proof (active HubSpot development)

### 2. Reduced Maintenance
- No custom security code to maintain
- HubSpot handles password resets, session management, CSRF protection
- Automatic security updates and compliance

### 3. Better Security
- HTTP-only cookies (can't be accessed by JavaScript)
- Built-in CSRF protection
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Two-factor authentication available

### 4. More Features
- SSO ready (SAML, OIDC)
- Social login (Google, Facebook)
- Passwordless authentication (magic links)
- Configurable session timeouts
- All without additional development

### 5. Simpler Code
- Remove email prompt modal
- Remove JWT token management
- Remove custom session validation
- Remove token refresh logic
- **Most work is deleting code, not writing new code**

### 6. Better User Experience
**Before (JWT):**
1. Click "Sign in"
2. Email prompt modal
3. Submit email
4. JWT token generated
5. Still need password for other HubSpot features

**After (HubSpot Native):**
1. Click "Sign in"
2. HubSpot login page (password/social/passwordless options)
3. Session established
4. Redirect back to course
5. Done

## Addressing Original Concerns

### Concern: "Membership API returns 404 on public pages"
**Response:** True but irrelevant.
- The API endpoint does return 404 for security
- **However**, HubL variables work on public pages
- Authentication state available via server-side rendering
- No client-side API call needed

### Concern: "Need custom auth for public pages with optional authentication"
**Response:** False.
- HubSpot Memberships work on public pages
- Authentication is optional (content remains public)
- HubL provides conditional rendering
- This is HubSpot's recommended pattern

### Concern: "JWT provides better UX"
**Response:** Questionable.
- JWT adds extra step (email prompt before HubSpot login)
- HubSpot native is simpler (direct to login with multiple options)
- Users already familiar with HubSpot login experience

### Concern: "Tests need JWT"
**Response:** Valid but limited.
- Keep JWT for test automation (internal use)
- Don't expose to production users
- User-facing flows use HubSpot native

## Conclusion

**Issue #270's proposed approach is correct and aligns with HubSpot best practices.**

The current JWT implementation was built on the incorrect assumption that HubSpot authentication doesn't work on public pages. In reality:

1. **HubSpot Memberships work on public pages** via `request_contact.is_logged_in` HubL variable
2. **HubSpot deprecated JWT** in favor of OIDC (February 2025)
3. **Commercial LMS platforms** use HubSpot native authentication
4. **Custom JWT is not justified** for this use case

**Recommendation:** Proceed with Issue #270's implementation to:
- Simplify authentication by using HubSpot native Memberships
- Remove custom JWT from production (keep for testing only)
- Reduce maintenance burden and improve security
- Align with HubSpot's official "golden path"
