# Issue #205: Explicit Enrollment Flows Implementation Summary

**Issue**: Learn: Implement explicit enrollment flows for pathways and courses
**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing

## Overview

Implemented explicit enrollment functionality for pathways and courses, allowing authenticated learners to explicitly opt-in to learning content rather than relying on implicit page views.

## Acceptance Criteria Status

- ✅ Authenticated learners see "Enroll in Pathway" / "Start Course" CTA blocks on respective detail pages
- ✅ CTAs update button state and show confirmation UI within one second of click
- ✅ Enrollment state persists via `hh-enrollment-{type}-{slug}` localStorage keys
- ✅ UI rehydrates enrollment state on page load for returning sessions
- ✅ Enrollment events send `/events/track` payloads with enrollment details
- ⏳ Evidence (screenshots, beacon logs) to be collected during manual testing
- ⏳ Manual test script to be executed

## Implementation Details

### 1. New JavaScript Module: `enrollment.js`

**Location**: `clean-x-hedgehog-templates/assets/js/enrollment.js`

**Key Features**:
- Authentication context detection from HubL-rendered data attributes
- localStorage persistence with keys: `hh-enrollment-pathway-{slug}` and `hh-enrollment-course-{slug}`
- Beacon transmission using `navigator.sendBeacon()` with fetch fallback
- Toast notification system for user feedback
- Button state management (Enroll → Enrolling... → ✓ Enrolled)
- Debug mode support via `localStorage.setItem('HHL_DEBUG', 'true')`

**API**:
```javascript
window.hhInitEnrollment(contentType, slug)
// contentType: 'pathway' | 'course'
// slug: URL-safe identifier (e.g., 'course-authoring-expert')
```

### 2. Template Updates

#### Pathways Page (`pathways-page.html`)

**Changes**:
- Added CSS styles for `.enrollment-cta-block`, `.enrollment-cta-title`, `.enrollment-cta-description`, `.enrollment-button`
- Inserted enrollment CTA block after pathway header (line ~608)
- Conditionally rendered only for `request_contact.is_logged_in`
- Added `enrollment.js` script include with initialization
- Button text: "Enroll in Pathway" → "✓ Enrolled in Pathway"

#### Courses Page (`courses-page.html`)

**Changes**:
- Added identical CSS styles for enrollment UI components
- Inserted enrollment CTA block after course header (line ~543)
- Conditionally rendered only for `request_contact.is_logged_in`
- Added `enrollment.js` script include with initialization
- Button text: "Start Course" → "✓ Enrolled in Course"

### 3. Backend Updates

#### Lambda Handler (`src/api/lambda/index.ts`)

**Changes**:
- Added `learning_course_enrolled` to event type enum (line 136)
- Updated `persistViaContactProperties()` to handle course enrollment
- Progress state structure now supports:
  ```json
  {
    "pathway-slug": {
      "enrolled": true,
      "enrolled_at": "2025-10-19T15:30:00Z",
      "modules": {...}
    },
    "courses": {
      "course-slug": {
        "enrolled": true,
        "enrolled_at": "2025-10-19T15:30:00Z",
        "modules": {}
      }
    }
  }
  ```

#### TypeScript Types (`src/shared/types.ts`)

**Changes**:
- Added `'learning_course_enrolled'` to `TrackEventInput.eventName` union type

### 4. Event Payloads

#### Pathway Enrollment Event

```json
{
  "eventName": "learning_pathway_enrolled",
  "contactIdentifier": {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "contactId": "12345"
  },
  "payload": {
    "pathway_slug": "network-fundamentals",
    "ts": "2025-10-19T15:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

#### Course Enrollment Event

```json
{
  "eventName": "learning_course_enrolled",
  "contactIdentifier": {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "contactId": "12345"
  },
  "payload": {
    "course_slug": "course-authoring-101",
    "ts": "2025-10-19T15:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Technical Architecture

### Enrollment Flow Sequence

1. **Page Load**:
   - HubSpot template renders auth context in hidden `<div id="hhl-auth-context">`
   - `enrollment.js` loads and reads authentication state
   - If not authenticated: hide enrollment CTA
   - If authenticated: check localStorage for existing enrollment
   - Update button UI based on enrollment state

2. **User Clicks "Enroll"**:
   - Button disabled, text changes to "Enrolling..."
   - localStorage updated with enrollment state and timestamp
   - Beacon sent to `/events/track` endpoint
   - After 500ms delay (simulated network):
     - Button UI updates to "✓ Enrolled" with green styling
     - Toast notification appears: "Successfully enrolled in [pathway/course]!"
     - Button remains disabled (enrollment is one-time action)

3. **Backend Processing**:
   - Lambda receives enrollment event
   - Validates schema with Zod
   - Looks up contact by email or contactId
   - Fetches current `hhl_progress_state` JSON property
   - Updates progress state with enrollment details
   - Writes back to contact properties:
     - `hhl_progress_state` (JSON string)
     - `hhl_progress_updated_at` (YYYY-MM-DD)
     - `hhl_progress_summary` (human-readable)

4. **Subsequent Visits**:
   - `enrollment.js` reads localStorage on page load
   - Button immediately renders in "✓ Enrolled" state
   - No additional API calls needed for UI state

### Data Persistence Layers

1. **Client-Side (localStorage)**:
   - Key: `hh-enrollment-{type}-{slug}`
   - Value: `{"enrolled": true, "enrolled_at": "2025-10-19T15:30:00Z"}`
   - Purpose: Instant UI rehydration, offline support

2. **Server-Side (HubSpot CRM)**:
   - Property: `hhl_progress_state` (Long text)
   - Format: JSON object with nested pathway/course/module data
   - Purpose: Cross-device sync, reporting, personalization

### UI Component Styling

**Enrollment CTA Block**:
- Background: Light blue gradient (`#f0f9ff` to `#e0f2fe`)
- Border: 2px solid `#0284c7`
- Padding: 24px
- Text alignment: Center

**Enrollment Button States**:

| State | Background | Text | Cursor | Border |
|-------|-----------|------|--------|--------|
| Default | `#1a4e8a` | "Enroll in Pathway" / "Start Course" | pointer | none |
| Hover | `#154171` | (unchanged) | pointer | none |
| Enrolling | `#1a4e8a` | "Enrolling..." | not-allowed | none |
| Enrolled | `#D1FAE5` | "✓ Enrolled in [type]" | not-allowed | 2px `#6EE7B7` |

**Toast Notifications**:
- Success: Green background (`#D1FAE5`), green border (`#6EE7B7`)
- Position: Fixed top-right
- Duration: 3 seconds with fade-out
- Animation: Slide-in from right

## Deployment Steps (Issue #181 Runbook)

### 1. Publish Templates

```bash
# Publish pathways page template
node dist-cjs/scripts/hubspot/publish-template.js \
  --path "CLEAN x HEDGEHOG/templates/learn/pathways-page.html" \
  --local "clean-x-hedgehog-templates/learn/pathways-page.html" \
  --validate-env published

# Publish courses page template
node dist-cjs/scripts/hubspot/publish-template.js \
  --path "CLEAN x HEDGEHOG/templates/learn/courses-page.html" \
  --local "clean-x-hedgehog-templates/learn/courses-page.html" \
  --validate-env published

# Publish enrollment.js asset
node dist-cjs/scripts/hubspot/publish-template.js \
  --path "CLEAN x HEDGEHOG/templates/assets/js/enrollment.js" \
  --local "clean-x-hedgehog-templates/assets/js/enrollment.js" \
  --validate-env published
```

### 2. Deploy Lambda

```bash
# Build TypeScript (already done)
npm run build

# Deploy to AWS
npm run deploy:aws
```

### 3. Verify Deployment

```bash
# Run public verification scripts
node scripts/verify-auth-mvp.js
node scripts/verify-detail-content.js
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Enrollment is One-Time**: Once enrolled, users cannot unenroll through the UI
2. **Client-Side Only Toast**: Toast notifications only appear on the current device
3. **No Email Confirmation**: No email sent upon enrollment (future enhancement)
4. **No Progress Dashboard Integration**: Enrollment status not yet shown on My Learning page

## Future Enhancements

1. Add enrollment indicators to pathway/course cards on list pages
2. Show enrollment count on My Learning dashboard
3. Add "Continue Learning" CTA for enrolled content
4. Implement unenrollment flow
5. Send enrollment confirmation emails
6. Add enrollment analytics to reporting dashboard
7. Pre-populate enrollment state from CRM on page load (requires `/progress/read` API call)

## Evidence Collection
