# Issue #206 Implementation Summary

## Extend Lambda with explicit enrollment tracking

**Issue:** https://github.com/afewell-hh/hh-learn/issues/206
**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Status:** Implementation Complete, Ready for Deployment

---

## Overview

Extended the AWS Lambda backend to support explicit enrollment tracking with queryable records. The implementation adds:

1. **Enhanced Event Tracking**: `/events/track` now accepts and persists `enrollment_source`, `pathway_slug`, and `course_slug` as top-level fields
2. **New Enrollment Endpoint**: `/enrollments/list` returns all enrolled pathways/courses with timestamps and source tracking
3. **Frontend Integration**: Updated `enrollment.js` to automatically detect and send enrollment source
4. **Integration Tests**: Created test script to verify endpoint functionality

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes

#### `src/shared/types.ts`
- Added `enrollment_source`, `pathway_slug`, and `course_slug` as optional top-level fields to `TrackEventInput` type
- These fields complement the existing `payload` object for easier backend processing

#### `src/api/lambda/index.ts`
- **New endpoint**: `GET /enrollments/list`
  - Requires `email` or `contactId` query parameter
  - Returns structured enrollment data with timestamps and sources
  - Returns 400 if no identifier provided
  - Returns 404 if contact not found
  - Returns 401 if CRM progress disabled

- **Enhanced tracking**: `POST /events/track`
  - Accepts `enrollment_source`, `pathway_slug`, `course_slug` at top level (in addition to payload)
  - Persists `enrollment_source` to CRM contact properties
  - Validates new fields using Zod schema
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing payload-based approach

- **Updated persistence**: `persistViaContactProperties()`
  - Extracts enrollment fields from top-level or payload
  - Stores `enrollment_source` alongside `enrolled` and `enrolled_at`
  - Properly handles both pathway and course enrollments

#### `serverless.yml`
- Added new HTTP API route: `GET /enrollments/list`
- No environment variable changes required
- Uses existing `ENABLE_CRM_PROGRESS` and `PROGRESS_BACKEND` settings

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### `clean-x-hedgehog-templates/assets/js/enrollment.js`
- Automatically detects enrollment source from current URL path:
  - `/pathways/*` → `"pathway_page"`
  - `/courses/*` → `"course_page"`
  - `/learn` or `/` → `"catalog"`
  - Other → `"unknown"`
- Sends `enrollment_source` as top-level field in event payload
- Sends `pathway_slug` or `course_slug` as top-level fields for easier backend parsing
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing beacon implementation

### 3. Testing

#### `tests/test-enrollments-api.sh`
New integration test script covering:
- ✅ Request without parameters (expects 400)
- ✅ Request with valid email (expects 200 with proper structure)
- ✅ Request with non-existent email (expects 404)
- ✅ Validates response structure: `mode`, `enrollments.pathways`, `enrollments.courses`

## API Specification

### GET /enrollments/list

**Query Parameters:**
- `email` (string, optional): Contact email address
- `contactId` (string, optional): HubSpot contact ID
- At least one identifier required

**Success Response (200):**
```json
{
  "mode": "authenticated",
  "enrollments": {
    "pathways": [
      {
        "slug": "course-authoring-expert",
        "enrolled_at": "2025-10-19T12:34:56.789Z",
        "enrollment_source": "pathway_page"
      }
    ],
    "courses": [
      {
        "slug": "course-authoring-101",
        "enrolled_at": "2025-10-19T12:30:00.000Z",
        "enrollment_source": "catalog"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- `400 Bad Request`: Missing email/contactId
- `401 Unauthorized`: CRM progress not enabled
- `404 Not Found`: Contact not found
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server error

### POST /events/track (Enhanced)

**Request Body (New Fields):**
```json
{
  "eventName": "learning_pathway_enrolled",
  "contactIdentifier": {
    "email": "user@example.com"
  },
  "enrollment_source": "pathway_page",
  "pathway_slug": "course-authoring-expert",
  "payload": {
    "ts": "2025-10-19T12:34:56.789Z"
  }
}
```

**Backward Compatibility:**
The endpoint still accepts the old format with fields in `payload`:
```json
{
  "eventName": "learning_course_enrolled",
  "contactIdentifier": {
    "email": "user@example.com"
  },
  "payload": {
    "course_slug": "course-authoring-101",
    "enrollment_source": "catalog",
    "ts": "2025-10-19T12:34:56.789Z"
  }
}
```

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
- AWS credentials configured
- Environment variables set (see below)
- HubSpot Project Access Token configured

### Environment Variables

**No new environment variables required.** The implementation uses existing variables:

- `HUBSPOT_PROJECT_ACCESS_TOKEN` - HubSpot API authentication (required)
- `ENABLE_CRM_PROGRESS` - Must be `"true"` for enrollment tracking (required)
- `PROGRESS_BACKEND` - Should be `"properties"` (default)
- `AWS_REGION` - AWS deployment region (default: us-east-1)
- `APP_STAGE` - Deployment stage (default: dev)

### Deployment Steps

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to AWS:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:aws
   ```
   OR
   ```bash
   serverless deploy
   ```

3. **Note the API Gateway URL** from deployment output:
   ```
   endpoints:
     POST - https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/events/track
     POST - https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/quiz/grade
     GET - https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/progress/read
     GET - https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/enrollments/list
   ```

4. **Update constants.json** if API URL changed:
   ```bash
   # Update TRACK_EVENTS_URL in clean-x-hedgehog-templates/config/constants.json
   npm run publish:constants
   ```

## Verification Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [x] TypeScript build succeeds (`npm run build`)
- [x] No lint errors

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Run integration tests: `./tests/test-enrollments-api.sh`
- [ ] Verify `/enrollments/list` returns proper structure
- [ ] Test enrollment flow end-to-end:
  1. User enrolls in pathway from pathway page
  2. Check `/enrollments/list` shows enrollment with `enrollment_source: "pathway_page"`
  3. Verify CRM contact properties updated
- [ ] Check CloudWatch logs for any errors
- [ ] Save verification outputs to `verification-output/issue-206/`

## Testing Commands

### Manual API Testing

```bash
# Set your API URL and test email
export API_URL="https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com"
export TEST_EMAIL="test@hedgehog.cloud"

# Test 1: Missing parameters (should return 400)
curl "${API_URL}/enrollments/list"

# Test 2: Valid request
curl "${API_URL}/enrollments/list?email=${TEST_EMAIL}" | jq

# Test 3: Track enrollment with source
curl -X POST "${API_URL}/events/track" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "eventName": "learning_pathway_enrolled",
    "contactIdentifier": {"email": "'${TEST_EMAIL}'"},
    "enrollment_source": "pathway_page",
    "pathway_slug": "test-pathway",
    "payload": {"ts": "'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"}
  }' | jq

# Test 4: Verify enrollment persisted
curl "${API_URL}/enrollments/list?email=${TEST_EMAIL}" | jq
```

### Run Integration Tests

```bash
export API_URL="https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com"
export HUBSPOT_TEST_USERNAME="test@hedgehog.cloud"

./tests/test-enrollments-api.sh
```

## Logging and Metrics

### CloudWatch Log Groups
- `/aws/lambda/hedgehog-learn-<stage>-api`

### Structured Logging
The implementation includes structured logging for:
- `listEnrollments` errors: Contact lookup failures, parsing errors
- `track` events: Enhanced with enrollment source logging
- `persistViaContactProperties`: Enrollment source persistence

### Sample Log Entries

**Successful enrollment tracking:**
```
Track event (persisted via properties) learning_pathway_enrolled { email: 'user@example.com' }
```

**Enrollment list retrieval:**
```
listEnrollments: Found 2 pathway enrollments, 1 course enrollment for contact 12345
```

---

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible** with existing implementations:

1. **Old beacon format still works**: Fields in `payload` object are extracted
2. **Existing enrollments readable**: `/enrollments/list` handles records without `enrollment_source`
3. **No breaking changes**: All existing endpoints and behaviors preserved
4. **Graceful degradation**: Missing `enrollment_source` shows as `null` in response

---
