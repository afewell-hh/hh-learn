## Quick Start

### 1. Review Implementation

```bash
cat IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md
```

### 2. Deploy to AWS

```bash
# Follow the deployment guide
cat DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md

# Build
npm run build

# Deploy
npm run deploy:aws
```

### 3. Run Integration Tests

```bash
# Set your API URL
export API_URL="https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com"
export HUBSPOT_TEST_USERNAME="test@hedgehog.cloud"

# Run tests
../../tests/test-enrollments-api.sh
```

### 4. Run Demo

```bash
# Run the sample curl commands
./sample-curl-commands.sh
```

## Implementation Highlights

### New Endpoint

```
GET /enrollments/list?email=user@example.com
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "mode": "authenticated",
  "enrollments": {
    "pathways": [
      {
        "slug": "pathway-name",
        "enrolled_at": "2025-10-19T12:34:56.789Z",
        "enrollment_source": "pathway_page"
      }
    ],
    "courses": [...]
  }
}
```

### Enhanced Tracking

```
POST /events/track
```

Now accepts:
```json
{
  "eventName": "learning_pathway_enrolled",
  "contactIdentifier": {"email": "user@example.com"},
  "enrollment_source": "pathway_page",  // NEW!
  "pathway_slug": "pathway-name",       // NEW! (top-level)
  "payload": {...}
}
```

### Frontend Integration

`enrollment.js` automatically detects enrollment source:
- `/pathways/*` → `"pathway_page"`
- `/courses/*` → `"course_page"`
- `/learn` → `"catalog"`

## Success Criteria

- [x] Build succeeds with no TypeScript errors
- [x] Integration tests created
- [x] Comprehensive documentation provided
- [ ] Deployment completed successfully
- [ ] All integration tests pass
- [ ] CloudWatch logs show no errors
- [ ] CRM properties contain enrollment_source

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to AWS Lambda
2. Run integration tests
3. Verify CRM persistence
4. Monitor for 24 hours
5. Document findings
6. Close Issue #206
