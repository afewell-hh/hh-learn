**Date:** 2026-04-12
**Branch:** issue-411-shadow-my-learning-tasks
**Scope:** Shadow-only — no production template changes

### Modified files
- `src/api/lambda/index.ts` — import + route for handleTasksStatusBatch
- `serverless.yml` — add GET /tasks/status/batch httpApi route

### Unchanged (verified)
- `clean-x-hedgehog-templates/learn/my-learning.html` — production template **not modified**
  (curl check: `shadow-mode-banner: 0`, `data-shadow: 0`, `shadow-my-learning: 0`)

## Design Decision: Batch Endpoint

**Question from issue:** Is N ≤ 8 per learner, or does a batch endpoint need to be implemented?

**Answer:** NLH has 4 courses × 4 modules = 16 modules. A fully enrolled learner hits 16 module status records at page load. This exceeds the ≤ 8 N+1 threshold in the issue spec.

**Decision:** Implemented `GET /tasks/status/batch` to retrieve all module statuses in a single DynamoDB BatchGetItem call.

## GET /tasks/status/batch

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Route | `GET /tasks/status/batch?module_slugs=slug1,slug2,...` |
| Max slugs | 25 |
| Shadow guard | 403 if APP_STAGE !== 'shadow' |
| Auth | Cognito httpOnly cookie |
| DB call | DynamoDB BatchGetItem (single round-trip) |
| Response | `{ statuses: { [moduleSlug]: { module_status, tasks } } }` |
| Missing slug | `{ module_status: "not_started", tasks: {} }` |
| Endpoint URL | `https://api.hedgehog.cloud/tasks/status/batch` |

**Smoke test (unauthenticated):**
```
GET https://jcsb8mv5qk.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tasks/status/batch?module_slugs=fabric-operations-welcome
→ 401 {"error":"Unauthorized"}  ✓ (shadow guard passes, auth required)
```

## Shadow My Learning UX Behavior

### Page-Load Flow (2 Lambda API calls)
1. `GET /enrollments/list` — enrolled courses from CRM
2. HubDB API — module slugs + `completion_tasks_json` per enrolled course
3. `GET /tasks/status/batch?module_slugs=slug1,...` — shadow DynamoDB task statuses

### Shadow Banner
Always visible at top of page:
> **Shadow mode** — progress data shown here is from the shadow environment and is not your production learning record.

### Per-Module Task Status (inline in course card module list)
- Quiz passed: `Quiz: Passed (X%)` (green pill)
- Quiz failed: `Quiz: Failed (X%, attempt N)` (red pill)
- Quiz not started: `Quiz: Not started` (grey pill)
- Lab completed: `Lab: Completed` (green pill)
- Lab not started: `Lab: Not started` (grey pill)
- No required tasks: `No required tasks` (light green italic pill)

Modules with no required tasks (`troubleshooting-framework`, `foundations-recap` knowledge_check-only) are shown as "No required tasks" — not blocked as incomplete.

### Course Completion Badge
- Derived client-side: course is "complete" when all module statuses are `complete` (or have no required tasks)
- Badges: `Completed` (green), `In Progress` (blue), `Not Started` (grey)

### Module Links
All module links use `/learn-shadow/modules/<slug>` (not `/learn/<slug>`).

### Progress Stats
- `Complete` counter: courses where all modules are done
- `In Progress` counter: courses partially done
- `Enrolled` counter: total enrolled courses

## Acceptance Criteria Status

| AC | Status |
|---|---|
| Shadow My Learning shows "Shadow mode" banner | ✓ |
| Per-module task status displayed (quiz score/status, lab attested/not) | ✓ |
| Module completion from shadow DynamoDB (NOT hhl_progress_state) | ✓ |
| All required tasks complete → "✓ Complete" | ✓ |
| Course "complete" when all modules complete (client-side) | ✓ |
| Production My Learning template unchanged | ✓ |

## Live Testing Protocol

After completing quiz + lab attestation for `fabric-operations-welcome` in shadow env:

1. Navigate to `/learn-shadow/my-learning`
2. Shadow banner visible at top ← verify
3. Module `fabric-operations-welcome` shows: Quiz: Passed (X%) + Lab: Completed pills ← verify
4. Module `fabric-operations-welcome` shows module status = complete ← verify
5. Navigate to `/learn/my-learning` — confirm no shadow elements ← verify

Additional checks:
- `fabric-operations-troubleshooting-framework` (no required tasks) → "No required tasks" pill
- `fabric-operations-foundations-recap` (knowledge_check only) → "No required tasks" pill
- `fabric-operations-vpc-provisioning` (lab only) → Quiz pill absent, Lab pill present

## API Endpoints Used

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /enrollments/list` | CRM enrollment context |
| `GET /tasks/status/batch?module_slugs=...` | Shadow DynamoDB batch task status |
| HubDB `/hs/api/hubdb/v3/tables/.../rows?...` | Module metadata + completion_tasks_json |

All shadow Lambda calls use `credentials: 'include'` for Cognito cookie auth.
