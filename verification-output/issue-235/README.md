# Issue #235 – Identity Aggregator Refactor (PR #241 Verification)

**Review Date:** 2025-10-21  
**Reviewer:** Codex  
**Status:** Code merged, blocked by public-page auth dependency

## Scope Recap

- Refactored enrollment/UI scripts to consume the new shared identity bootstrapper (`auth-context.js`).  
- Normalized CTA copy, click handlers, and identity resolution across courses, pathways, and My Learning UIs.  
- Aligned with Issue #234 bootstrapper work so downstream modules no longer query HubL membership variables directly【turn5view0†234】【turn6view0†235】.

## Verification Summary

| Check | Result | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Static analysis / lint | ✅ | `npm run lint` (no bootstrapper-specific lint errors) |
| Build | ✅ | `npm run build` completes (no regressions in bundling identity assets) |
| Playwright – enrollment flow | ❌ | Still fails because membership profile API returns 404 on public pages (see Issue #233 log) |

## Impacted Files (non-exhaustive)

- `clean-x-hedgehog-templates/assets/js/auth-context.js`
- `clean-x-hedgehog-templates/assets/js/enrollment.js`
- `clean-x-hedgehog-templates/assets/js/courses.js`
- `clean-x-hedgehog-templates/assets/js/pathways.js`
- `clean-x-hedgehog-templates/assets/js/my-learning.js`

## Follow-ups

1. Dependent on the new P0 (“Design & implement public-page authentication alternative”) triggered by Issue #239.  
2. Keep Playwright failure documented until alternative auth is implemented.  
3. Re-run verification once `/learn` pages can surface authenticated identity without relying on `/_hcms/api/membership/v1/profile`.

Artifacts:
- Shared log with Issue #233 (`verification-output/issue-233/playwright-test-results.log`) until alternative auth exists.
