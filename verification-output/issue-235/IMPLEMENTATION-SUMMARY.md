# Implementation Summary – Issue #235

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Goal | Reuse the membership identity bootstrapper across all Learn UI surfaces |
| PR | #241 |
| Status | Merged (2025-10-21) |
| Blockers | Membership profile endpoint returns 404 on public pages (Issue #233) |

## What Changed

- Introduced shared `auth-context.js` loader that exposes `window.hhIdentity.ready()` and `.get()` helpers.  
- Updated enrollment, course, pathway, and dashboard scripts to consume the shared helper instead of reading HubL data attributes directly.  
- Normalized CTA state transitions and string resources to remove copy drift.

## Testing & Evidence

- `npm run lint` → ✅  
- `npm run build` → ✅  
- `npx playwright test tests/e2e/enrollment-flow.spec.ts` → ❌ (CTA remains “Sign in to start course”; identity empty; see Issue #233 log)

## Next Steps

1. Deliver public-page authentication alternative (new P0 ticket linked to Issue #239).  
2. Update CTA copy/analytics expectations once identity resolution works for public pages.  
3. Capture a fresh Playwright run post-auth fix and upload to this directory.
