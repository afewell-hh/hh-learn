**API Response** (from /enrollments/list):
```json
[Paste the enrollment list API response here]
```

**Browser Console Log**:
```
[Paste console log here - should show "[hhl-enroll] Initialized (CRM)"]
```

### Test 3: Cross-Device Consistency - Enroll on Device A, View on Device B

**Setup**:
1. Device A: Chrome on Desktop (or primary browser)
2. Device B: Different browser or incognito mode with same logged-in user

**Steps**:
1. **Device A**: Navigate to a course where user is NOT enrolled
2. **Device A**: Click "Start Course" button to enroll
3. **Device A**: Verify button changes to "✓ Enrolled in Course"
4. **Device B**: Navigate to the SAME course page
5. **Device B**: Verify button automatically shows "✓ Enrolled in Course"

**Expected Behavior**:
- [ ] Device A shows enrollment after clicking
- [ ] Device B shows enrollment WITHOUT clicking (CRM source of truth)
- [ ] No duplicate enrollment possible from Device B

**Screenshots**:
- [ ] `cross-device-a-after-enroll.png` - Device A after enrollment
- [ ] `cross-device-b-enrolled-state.png` - Device B showing enrolled state

### Test 4: Prevent Duplicate Enrollments

**Setup**:
1. User already enrolled in a course (verify in CRM)
2. Clear localStorage to simulate "fresh" browser state

**URL**: https://hedgehog.cloud/learn/courses/{enrolled-course-slug}?hs_no_cache=1

**Expected Behavior**:
- [ ] Button shows "✓ Enrolled in Course" on page load
- [ ] Button is disabled - cannot click to enroll again
- [ ] No duplicate enrollment event sent to CRM
- [ ] Check CRM contact record - only ONE enrollment record for this course

**Screenshots**:
- [ ] `prevent-duplicate-button-state.png` - Disabled enrolled button

**CRM Verification**:
```
Contact ID: [ID]
Course Slug: [slug]
Enrollment Count: [should be 1]
Enrollment Timestamp: [timestamp]
```

### Test 5: Multi-Browser Persistence

**Setup**:
1. Browser 1: Enroll in pathway "course-authoring-expert"
2. Browser 2: Same user, different browser/incognito
3. Browser 3: Same user, mobile device (optional)

**Expected Behavior**:
- [ ] Browser 1: Shows "✓ Enrolled in Pathway"
- [ ] Browser 2: Shows "✓ Enrolled in Pathway" (without local storage)
- [ ] Browser 3: Shows "✓ Enrolled in Pathway" (without local storage)

**Screenshots**:
- [ ] `multi-browser-browser1.png` - Browser 1 state
- [ ] `multi-browser-browser2.png` - Browser 2 state
