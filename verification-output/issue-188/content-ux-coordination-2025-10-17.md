# Content & UX Follow-Up – Issue 188

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Prepared by:** Codex agent on behalf of ops

## Context
- Manual AWS deploy workflow still needs a successful run; owner notified with dispatch log `github-deploy-dispatch-2025-10-17T1857Z.log`.
- Runbook checklist items for Content and UX remain open (see `docs/learn-launch-runbook.md` § Post-Launch Monitoring and Success Criteria).

## Requests Sent
1. **Content Team:** Provide editorial QA confirmation for 15 published modules and 6 courses; capture in shared doc or comment thread. Reference assessment snapshots under `verification-output/issue-188/modules.html` and `courses.html`.
2. **UX Team:** Complete responsive + accessibility verification (mobile/tablet, Lighthouse, axe) for `/learn` landing, module detail, My Learning. Capture findings and attach proof in `verification-output/issue-188/` when ready.

## Supporting Artifacts
- HTTP status sweeps (modules/courses/pathways): `module-status-codes.txt`, `course-status-codes.txt`, `pathway-status-codes.txt`
- Beacon/API validation: `events-track-auth-response.json`, `progress-read-contact-auth-response.json`
- Cloud operations evidence: `aws-cloudwatch-alarms.json`, `aws-lambda-config-sanitized.json`

## Next Steps
- Await confirmations from Content + UX.
- Once confirmations arrive, append artifacts to this directory and update the runbook checkboxes accordingly.
