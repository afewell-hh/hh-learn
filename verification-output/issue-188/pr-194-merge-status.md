# PR #194 Merge Status

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**PR:** https://github.com/afewell-hh/hh-learn/pull/194
**Status:** Ready for merge, blocked by branch protection

---

## Summary

PR #194 is **ready to merge** but blocked by branch protection rules requiring:
1. At least 1 approving review from a reviewer with write access (not PR author)
2. Required status check: "Validate Detail Content / detail-content"

---

## Status Check Issue

### Current Situation
The workflow check is reporting as `"Validate Detail Content"` but branch protection expects `"Validate Detail Content / detail-content"`.

### Root Cause
GitHub Actions check names follow the format: `<workflow-name> / <job-id>`

Our fix changed the job ID to `detail-content`, but the check runs visible on the PR are from **before** this fix was pushed. The workflow file was updated in commit `5dfd545` but those check runs are from earlier commits.

### Why Checks Haven't Re-run
GitHub Actions only re-runs checks when:
- New commits are pushed to the PR
- Checks are manually re-run
- The PR is closed and reopened

The check runs showing on the PR are from commit `b98b4aa` (before our fix to the workflow file).

## What's Needed to Merge

### Option 1: Get an Approving Review (Recommended)
A team member with write access (not afewell-hh) needs to:
1. Review PR #194
2. Approve the PR

This will satisfy the review requirement. The status check issue will resolve itself once the PR is merged and future PRs use the fixed workflow.

### Option 2: Update Branch Protection Rule
Update the required status check from:
- `Validate Detail Content / detail-content`

To:
- `Validate Detail Content / detail`

This matches the current (pre-fix) check name. However, this isn't ideal because:
- Future PRs will use the fixed workflow (`detail-content` job ID)
- The branch protection would then be out of sync again

### Option 3: Owner Admin Override
The repository owner can use admin privileges to bypass the review requirement:

```bash
gh pr merge 194 --admin --squash
```

**Note:** This still won't work if the status check name doesn't match. The best solution is Option 1.

## Verification After Merge

Once merged, verify the fix works:

### 1. Test Workflow Dispatch
```bash
gh workflow run deploy-aws.yml --ref main -f stage=dev -f region=us-west-2 -f enable_crm_progress=true
```

### 2. Verify Run Created
```bash
gh run list --workflow=deploy-aws.yml --limit 3 --json event,createdAt,status
```

Should show a `workflow_dispatch` event.

### 3. Capture Logs
```bash
gh run list --workflow=deploy-aws.yml --limit 1 --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId' | \
  xargs -I {} gh run view {} --log > verification-output/issue-188/github-deploy-dispatch-success-$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H%M%SZ).log
```
