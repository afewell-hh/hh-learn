### Issue #191 - AI Agent Training Guide ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Deliverable:** `docs/hubspot-project-apps-agent-guide.md` (770 lines)

**Comprehensive guide covering:**
1. **Platform Overview** - Project Apps (2025.2) vs Private Apps (legacy)
2. **Authentication Patterns** - Static bearer tokens, NOT OAuth flows
3. **Required Scopes** - 7 scopes from app-hsmeta.json with purpose map
4. **Working with APIs** - Correct patterns and common mistakes
5. **External Serverless** - AWS Lambda integration architecture
6. **Debugging Patterns** - When to check resources before assuming auth issues
7. **Test Contacts** - Verification procedures with real examples
8. **Production Evidence** - Verified against live hedgehog.cloud/learn deployment
9. **Quick Reference** - TL;DR for authentication and key concepts
10. **Success Patterns** - Copy-paste examples for common tasks
11. **When Training Data Fails** - Red flags and how to search current docs
12. **References** - Links to internal docs and HubSpot official docs

**Key Messages for AI Agents:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Training data is outdated about HubSpot authentication
- ‚úÖ This app uses Project Apps 2025.2, not Private Apps
- ‚úÖ Tokens are static bearer tokens (44 chars, `pat-na1-...`)
- ‚ùå No OAuth flows despite confusing terminology in docs
- ‚ùå Tokens don't expire - don't assume 401 = expired token
- ‚úÖ Check resource exists before concluding auth is broken

**Documentation Updated:**
- Created `docs/hubspot-project-apps-agent-guide.md`
- Updated `docs/README.md` with prominent link for AI agents
- Commit: `80e2c1f`

### Issue #193 - Workflow Dispatch Bug ‚úÖ FIXED

**Root Cause:**
The `region` input in `.github/workflows/deploy-aws.yml` had `default: "${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}"`. GitHub Actions does not support secret references in workflow_dispatch input defaults, causing silent failures (HTTP 204 but no run created).

**Fix Applied:**
```yaml
# BEFORE (BROKEN)
region:
  required: true
  default: "${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}"

# AFTER (FIXED)
region:
  required: false
  default: "us-west-2"
```

**Pull Request:** #194 (ready for review and merge)
- Branch: `fix/issue-193-workflow-dispatch-bug`
- Commit: `071720e`
- Comprehensive PR description with testing instructions

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Manual workflow dispatch now works
- ‚úÖ Backward compatible with existing workflows
- ‚úÖ No impact on push-triggered deployments
- ‚úÖ Region can still be overridden at dispatch time

**Testing Instructions (after merge):**
```bash
gh workflow run deploy-aws.yml --ref main -f stage=dev -f region=us-west-2 -f enable_crm_progress=true
gh run list --workflow=deploy-aws.yml --limit 3  # Should show workflow_dispatch event
```

**Commits:**
- `071720e` - Workflow dispatch fix
