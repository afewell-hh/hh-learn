# Issue #197 Resolution Summary

## Issue
Manual runs of `.github/workflows/deploy-aws.yml` were failing with CloudFormation error:
```
Cannot delete ChangeSet in status CREATE_IN_PROGRESS
```

## Investigation (2025-10-18T17:13Z)

### CloudFormation Stack Status
- Stack Name: `hedgehog-learn-dev`
- Stack Status: `UPDATE_COMPLETE` (no issues found)
- Region: `us-west-2`
- ChangeSets: No stale ChangeSets detected

### Root Cause
The previous failure (run ID 18618316985 at 2025-10-18T16:48Z) encountered a transient CloudFormation state where a ChangeSet was still in `CREATE_IN_PROGRESS` status, preventing Serverless Framework from deleting it during deployment.

By the time investigation began (~25 minutes later), the CloudFormation stack had returned to a clean `UPDATE_COMPLETE` state with no lingering ChangeSets.

## Resolution

### Actions Taken
1. **Investigated CloudFormation stack**: Confirmed stack status was `UPDATE_COMPLETE` with no stale ChangeSets
2. **Re-triggered deployment**: Initiated new workflow_dispatch run (ID 18618585385)
3. **Successful deployment**: Workflow completed successfully in 1m42s

### Verification Results

#### Workflow Run Details
- **Run ID**: 18618585385
- **Trigger**: workflow_dispatch (manual)
- **Status**: ✓ Success
- **Duration**: 1m42s
- **Timestamp**: 2025-10-18T17:13:11Z
- **Branch**: main
- **Inputs**:
  - stage: `dev`
  - region: `us-west-2`
  - enable_crm_progress: `true`

#### Deployment Verification
```bash
# Lambda configuration confirmed
$ aws lambda get-function-configuration --function-name hedgehog-learn-dev-api
ENABLE_CRM_PROGRESS: true

# Stack last updated
$ aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name hedgehog-learn-dev
LastUpdatedTime: 2025-10-18T17:14:14.393000+00:00
```

#### Evidence Artifacts
- Successful deployment log: `verification-output/issue-188/github-deploy-dispatch-success-2025-10-18T171311Z.log`
- Failed deployment log (reference): `verification-output/issue-188/github-deploy-dispatch-attempt-2025-10-18T164845Z.log`

## Runbook Update
The manual deploy checkbox in `docs/learn-launch-runbook.md` (line 267) can now be marked complete:
- ✓ Deployment completes successfully
- ✓ ENABLE_CRM_PROGRESS confirmed as `true`
- ✓ CloudFormation stack successfully updated

## Next Steps
1. Update `docs/learn-launch-runbook.md` to reflect successful deployment
2. Close Issue #197
3. Update Issue #188 runbook verification status

## Notes
- The original ChangeSet error appears to have been transient
- No manual CloudFormation intervention was required
- Simply re-running the workflow after ~25 minutes resolved the issue
- Future occurrences of this error can likely be resolved by waiting a few minutes and retrying
