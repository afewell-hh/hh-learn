  --local "clean-x-hedgehog-templates/..."

## What Changed

### User-Facing Changes

**Before (JWT Authentication)**:
- User clicks "Sign in to start course"
- Modal prompts for email address
- Custom JWT token generated
- Token stored in localStorage
- Potential security and UX limitations

**After (Native Membership)**:
- User clicks "Sign in to start course"
- Redirects to `/_hcms/mem/login`
- Native HubSpot login form (supports SSO, social login, MFA)
- HTTP-only session cookie set by HubSpot
- Better security, simpler UX

### Technical Changes

**Authentication Flow**:
1. `login-helper.js` provides `buildLoginUrl()` function
2. `enrollment.js` calls `window.hhLoginHelper.login()` on CTA click
3. HubSpot redirects to `/_hcms/mem/login?redirect_url=<page>`
4. After successful login, HubSpot redirects back
5. Server renders page with `request_contact` data populated
6. Templates use HubL to populate `#hhl-auth-context` data attributes
7. `auth-context.js` reads attributes (Priority 0)
8. `window.hhIdentity` populated with user data

**Backward Compatibility**:
- JWT authentication still works (Priority 1 fallback)
- Used by automated tests
- Not user-facing

---

## Verification

### Live Page Check

Visit any course page to verify:
1. **Anonymous State**:
   - Visit: https://hedgehog.cloud/learn/courses/course-authoring-101
   - CTA should show "Sign in to start course"
   - Console: `document.getElementById('hhl-auth-context').dataset` should show empty strings

2. **Authenticated State** (after manual login):
   - Click "Sign in to start course"
   - Log in via HubSpot native form
   - After redirect back, CTA should change
   - Console: `document.getElementById('hhl-auth-context').dataset` should show email, contactId, etc.
   - Console: `window.hhIdentity.get()` should return identity object

### Expected Console Output

**Anonymous User**:
```javascript
document.getElementById('hhl-auth-context').dataset
// {email: "", contactId: "", firstname: null, lastname: null, ...}

window.hhIdentity.get()
// null or {email: "", contactId: ""}
```

**Authenticated User** (after successful login):
```javascript
document.getElementById('hhl-auth-context').dataset
// {email: "user@example.com", contactId: "12345", firstname: "John", lastname: "Doe", ...}

window.hhIdentity.get()
// {email: "user@example.com", contactId: "12345", firstname: "John", lastname: "Doe"}
```

## Impact

### Production Impact

**Immediate**:
- All public course pages now use native HubSpot login
- Users with valid membership accounts can log in
- Session persists across all pages (not just private)

**Security**:
- ✅ HTTP-only cookies (not accessible by JavaScript)
- ✅ Built-in CSRF protection
- ✅ HubSpot manages security updates
- ✅ No JWT tokens in localStorage for user-facing flows

**User Experience**:
- ✅ SSO support (SAML, OIDC)
- ✅ Social login (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- ✅ Passwordless authentication (magic links)
- ✅ Two-factor authentication
- ✅ Password reset flows managed by HubSpot

### Testing Impact

**Automated Tests**:
- JWT fallback still available for test automation
- Native login tests require valid membership credentials
- Manual verification recommended (see Issue #273)

## Next Steps

### For Manual Verification (Issue #273 - Phase 3)

1. **Test Login Flow**:
   - Clear browser cookies
   - Visit a course page
   - Click "Sign in to start course"
   - Complete login with valid membership credentials
   - Verify identity data populates

2. **Check Console**:
   - Before login: Verify empty data attributes
   - After login: Verify populated data attributes
   - Test `window.hhIdentity.get()` returns user data

3. **Test Enrollment**:
   - Verify CTA changes from "Sign in" to "Enroll" or "Start Course"
   - Click to enroll in course
   - Verify progress tracking works

4. **Document Results**:
   - Create `verification-output/issue-273/MANUAL-TEST-RESULTS.md`
   - Include screenshots and console output
   - Post to GitHub Issue #273

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback is possible:

### Quick Rollback

Previous versions exist in HubSpot's version history:
1. Open Design Manager
2. Navigate to each file
3. Click "History"
4. Restore previous version before this deployment

### Identify Files to Rollback

All files published today (2025-10-28):
- login-helper.js (can be deleted - didn't exist before)
- auth-context.js (restore to pre-Issue #272 version)
- enrollment.js (restore to JWT login version)
- All template files (restore to version without Issue #272 data attributes)
