# Issue #276: Fix Enrollment Persistence to CRM Across Browsers

## Quick Summary

**Problem**: Enrollments don't persist across browsers because `/learn/action-runner` page doesn't exist.

**Solution**: Created `action-runner.html` template - **manual CMS page creation required** in HubSpot UI.

**Status**: ✅ Template created and uploaded | ⚠️ Awaiting manual page creation
