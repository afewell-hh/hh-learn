## Executive Summary

This document provides verification results for Issue #230, which consolidates manual testing requirements for:
- **Issue #226**: Enrollment CTA visibility for logged-out users
- **Issue #227**: CRM-backed enrollment state persistence

### Overall Status: ✅ API VERIFICATION COMPLETE | ⚠️ MANUAL UI TESTING REQUIRED

---

## 1. API Endpoint Verification ✅

### 1.1 Authentication Endpoint (`/auth/login`)

**Endpoint**: `POST https://hvoog2lnha.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/auth/login`

**Test**: Login with QA test account
```bash
curl -X POST "https://hvoog2lnha.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"afewell@gmail.com"}'
```

**Result**: ✅ SUCCESS
```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "contactId": "59090639178",
  "email": "afewell@gmail.com",
  "firstname": "TestArt",
  "lastname": "TestFewell"
}
```

**Evidence**: `api/auth-login-response.json`

**Key Observations**:
- ✅ JWT token generated successfully
- ✅ Contact ID correctly mapped (59090639178)
- ✅ User profile data returned (firstname, lastname)
- ✅ Token valid for 24 hours (exp: 1761638491)

---

### 1.2 Enrollments List Endpoint (`/enrollments/list`)

**Endpoint**: `GET https://hvoog2lnha.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/enrollments/list?email=afewell@gmail.com`

**Test**: Retrieve enrollment data for authenticated user
```bash
curl -X GET "https://hvoog2lnha.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/enrollments/list?email=afewell@gmail.com" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

**Result**: ✅ SUCCESS
```json
{
  "mode": "authenticated",
  "enrollments": {
    "pathways": [
      {
        "slug": "api-test-pathway",
        "enrolled_at": "2025-10-26T04:02:46.075Z",
        "enrollment_source": "api_smoke_test"
      }
    ],
    "courses": [
      {
        "slug": "api-test-course",
        "pathway_slug": null,
        "enrolled_at": "2025-10-26T04:02:38.612Z",
        "enrollment_source": "api_smoke_test"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Evidence**: `api/enrollments-response.json`

**Key Observations**:
- ✅ Returns both pathway and course enrollments
- ✅ Includes enrollment timestamps (enrolled_at)
- ✅ Tracks enrollment source (api_smoke_test)
- ✅ Distinguishes between pathway-enrolled courses (pathway_slug) and standalone courses
- ✅ Properly authenticated mode response

**CRM Verification Status**:
- ✅ Enrollments tracked in HubSpot CRM contact record (Contact ID: 59090639178)
- ✅ Source attribution working (enrollment_source field populated)

---

### 1.3 Progress Read Endpoint (`/progress/read`)

**Endpoint**: `GET https://hvoog2lnha.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/progress/read?email=afewell@gmail.com`

**Test**: Retrieve hierarchical progress data
```bash
curl -X GET "https://hvoog2lnha.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/progress/read?email=afewell@gmail.com" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

**Result**: ✅ SUCCESS (see full response in `api/progress-response.json`)

**Summary Statistics**:
- **Total Pathways Tracked**: 2 (kubernetes-foundations, api-test-pathway)
- **Total Courses Tracked**: 1 (api-test-course)
- **Total Modules Tracked**: 9 modules across pathways/courses
- **Completion Status**:
  - kubernetes-foundations: 1/1 modules complete ✅
  - test-pathway-oauth: 0/4 modules complete ⚠️
  - api-test-course: 1/2 modules complete ⚠️
  - api-test-pathway: 0/1 modules complete ⚠️

**Evidence**: `api/progress-response.json`

**Key Observations**:
- ✅ Hierarchical structure preserved (pathways → courses → modules)
- ✅ Module-level granularity (started, completed states)
- ✅ Timestamp tracking (started_at, completed_at)
- ✅ Enrollment metadata included (enrolled, enrolled_at, enrollment_source)
- ✅ Progress summary generated correctly
- ✅ Last viewed tracking (type, slug, timestamp)
- ✅ Updated_at field shows last sync date (2025-10-26)

**Sample Module Progress**:
```json
{
  "kubernetes-foundations": {
    "modules": {
      "k8s-networking-fundamentals": {
        "started": true,
        "started_at": "2025-10-12T05:06:40.136Z",
        "completed": true,
        "completed_at": "2025-10-12T05:06:50.703Z"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

  - [ ] Button text: "Start Course" (NOT "Sign in to start course")
  - [ ] No helper text visible (sign-in guidance removed)
  - [ ] Button enabled and clickable
  - [ ] Click button → Shows "Enrolling..." loading state
  - [ ] After enrollment → Button shows "✓ Enrolled in Course"
  - [ ] Button becomes disabled (no re-enrollment possible)
  - [ ] Toast notification fires confirming enrollment
- **Evidence Required**:
  - Screenshot (before): `manual-tests/authenticated-course-before-enrollment.png`

- **Expected Behavior**:
  - [ ] On page load, button immediately shows "✓ Enrolled in Course"
  - [ ] Button is disabled (cannot re-enroll)
  - [ ] Network tab shows `/enrollments/list` API call fetching CRM state
  - [ ] No "Start Course" button visible (enrolled state persists)
- **Evidence Required**:
  - Screenshot: `manual-tests/authenticated-course-already-enrolled.png`
  - Network tab: Capture `/enrollments/list` request showing existing enrollment

#### Test 2.2.3: Cross-Device Enrollment Persistence
- **URL**: https://hedgehog.cloud/learn/pathways/api-test-pathway
- **Prerequisites**:
  - User already enrolled in "api-test-pathway" (per CRM data)

- ✅ `hhl_progress_updated_at` (custom property): Last update timestamp (2025-10-26)
- ✅ `hhl_progress_summary` (custom property): Human-readable summary

**Sample CRM Progress State**:
```json
{
  "courses": {
    "api-test-course": {
      "enrolled": true,
      "enrolled_at": "2025-10-26T04:02:38.612Z",
      "enrollment_source": "api_smoke_test",
      "modules": {
        "api-test-module-started": {
          "started": true,
          "started_at": "2025-10-26T04:02:41.150Z"
        },
        "api-test-module-completed": {
          "completed": true,
          "completed_at": "2025-10-26T04:02:43.789Z"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 4. Automated Test Results ✅

### Issue #226 Offline Tests (Playwright)
**Status**: ✅ ALL PASSING
```
✓ shows sign-in prompt for anonymous visitors (640ms)
✓ uses CRM enrollment data when available (527ms)
```
**Evidence**: `verification-output/issue-226/VERIFICATION-TEMPLATE.md`

### Issue #227 Offline Tests (Playwright)
**Status**: ✅ ALL PASSING
- Enrollment state fetching from CRM
- Cross-device persistence logic
- Duplicate enrollment prevention

### Issue #221 Unit Tests (Completion Tracking)
**Status**: ✅ 43/43 PASSING (as of 2025-10-20)
**Evidence**: `verification-output/issue-221/test-summary.md`

---

## 5. Known Issues and Blockers

### 5.1 Authentication Gap (Issues #233, #239, #242)
**Status**: ⚠️ BLOCKING FULL VERIFICATION

**Problem**: Membership-based authentication returns 404 on public pages when not logged in. This prevents:
- Full anonymous visitor testing (Issue #226)
- OAuth proxy alternative implementation (Issue #242)

**Current Workaround**: JWT-based authentication working for API calls, but UI flows may differ

**Impact**: Manual UI tests in Section 2 may encounter authentication redirects or errors

**Next Steps**:
- Implement OAuth proxy alternative (Issue #242)
- Retest anonymous visitor flows after fix
