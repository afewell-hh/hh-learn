# Issue #248 Verification Output

**Issue:** [#248 - Implement API-level membership smoke tests](https://github.com/afewell-hh/hh-learn/issues/248)
**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Summary

Successfully implemented API-level smoke tests for membership-related flows. These tests provide automated regression coverage without relying on HubSpot's membership UI login (blocked by CSRF protection).

## Deliverables

### 1. Test Suite (`tests/api/membership-smoke.spec.ts`)

Comprehensive Playwright test suite covering:

- ✅ Course enrollment flow
  - Enroll via `/events/track`
  - Verify via `/enrollments/list`
  - Track module progress (started/completed)
  - Verify via `/progress/read`

- ✅ Pathway enrollment flow
  - Enroll in pathway
  - Track pathway module progress

- ✅ Progress aggregation
  - Course completion statistics
  - Pathway completion statistics

- ✅ Anonymous vs authenticated behavior
  - Anonymous events (logged only)
  - Authenticated events (persisted to CRM)

- ✅ Error handling
  - Invalid payloads
  - Missing required fields
  - Invalid email formats

**Total Tests:** 13 test scenarios

### 2. Test Data Helpers (`tests/api/helpers/hubspot-cleanup.ts`)

Utilities for managing test data in HubSpot CRM:

- `resetContactProgress(email)` - Clear all progress
- `clearModuleProgress(email, moduleSlugs)` - Clear specific modules
- `deleteTestEnrollments(email, options)` - Remove test enrollments
- `getContactProgress(email)` - Inspect progress state
- `ensureTestContact(email, properties)` - Create/update test contact
- `findContactByEmail(email)` - Lookup contact ID

**Lines of Code:** ~350 lines (fully documented)

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/api-smoke-tests.yml`)

CI/CD integration with:

- ✅ Runs on push to main
- ✅ Runs on pull requests
- ✅ Nightly schedule (2 AM UTC)
- ✅ Manual trigger support
- ✅ Two jobs:
  - `api-smoke-tests` - Full Playwright suite
  - `verify-endpoints` - Quick health checks

**Required Secrets:**
- `HUBSPOT_TEST_EMAIL`
- `HUBSPOT_PROJECT_ACCESS_TOKEN`

**Optional Secrets:**
- `HUBSPOT_TEST_CONTACT_ID`
- `API_BASE_URL`
- `HUBSPOT_API_TOKEN`
- `HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_APP_TOKEN`

### 4. Documentation

**Primary Documentation:** `tests/api/README.md` (400+ lines)

Covers:
- Overview and rationale
- Test coverage details
- Running tests locally
- CI/CD integration
- Test data management
- Troubleshooting guide
- Contributing guidelines

**Updated Documentation:**
- `docs/auth-and-progress.md` - Added "Automated Testing" section

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Why Playwright over Vitest/Jest?

**Chosen:** Playwright's `APIRequest` context

**Rationale:**
- Consistent with existing E2E test infrastructure
- Built-in request context with automatic cleanup
- Excellent test reporting (HTML, JSON, trace viewer)
- No additional test framework dependencies

### 2. Test Data Strategy

**Chosen:** Non-destructive test data with unique prefixes

**Rationale:**
- Prefix all test slugs with `api-test-` to avoid conflicts
- Use existing test contact (don't create/delete contacts)
- Cleanup helpers available but not mandatory
- Tests are idempotent (can run multiple times safely)

### 3. CI/CD Triggers

**Chosen:** Push, PR, Nightly, Manual

**Rationale:**
- **Push/PR:** Catch regressions before merge
- **Nightly:** Regular health checks, catch infrastructure issues
- **Manual:** Ad-hoc testing, debugging

### 4. Secrets Management

**Chosen:** GitHub Secrets with fallback defaults

**Rationale:**
- Secure token storage
- Easy rotation without code changes
- Fallback to production URL if not overridden
- Support for multiple token types (migration flexibility)

- [ ] Migrate to alternative auth once available
- [ ] Add UI tests for authenticated flows
- [ ] Integrate with monitoring dashboards

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Research First:** Issue #247 research prevented wasted effort on UI automation
2. **API-First Testing:** Reliable, fast, no CSRF issues
3. **Helper Utilities:** Reusable cleanup functions save time
4. **Comprehensive Docs:** Reduces onboarding friction

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Token Precedence:** Supported multiple token types for migration flexibility
2. **Test Data Management:** Created helpers to avoid manual cleanup
3. **CI/CD Secrets:** Designed workflow to work with optional secrets

### Would Do Differently

1. **Earlier Coordination:** Could have parallelized docs and code
2. **Mock Data:** Consider adding mock API responses for unit tests
