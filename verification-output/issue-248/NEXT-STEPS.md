# Issue #248 - Next Steps

**Status:** ✅ Implementation Complete, ⚠️ Configuration Required
**Date:** 2025-10-26

## Summary

The API smoke test suite has been successfully implemented and executed. The tests are **working correctly** - they identified that the Lambda function needs `ENABLE_CRM_PROGRESS=true` to persist events to HubSpot CRM.

**Current State:**
- ✅ Test suite implemented (13 scenarios)
- ✅ Helper utilities created
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow configured
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ⚠️ Lambda configuration needs update

## Critical Finding from Dry-Run

**Issue:** Lambda function has `ENABLE_CRM_PROGRESS=false`

**Impact:** Events are being logged but not persisted to CRM

**Evidence:**
```
Expected: status = "persisted"
Actual:   status = "logged"
```

**This is actually good news!** The tests caught a configuration issue before it could affect production.

## Required Action: Enable CRM Progress in Lambda

You have **three options** to fix this:

### Option 1: Redeploy Lambda with Correct Environment Variable (RECOMMENDED)

```bash
# Set environment variable
export ENABLE_CRM_PROGRESS=true

# Redeploy
npm run deploy:aws
```

This updates the Lambda environment variables and redeploys the function.

### Option 2: Update serverless.yml Default

Edit `serverless.yml`:

```yaml
# Before:
ENABLE_CRM_PROGRESS: ${env:ENABLE_CRM_PROGRESS, 'false'}

# After:
ENABLE_CRM_PROGRESS: ${env:ENABLE_CRM_PROGRESS, 'true'}
```

Then redeploy:
```bash
npm run deploy:aws
```

### Option 3: Update Lambda Configuration Directly (FASTEST)

Use AWS CLI to update the running Lambda without redeploying:

```bash
# Get current config
aws lambda get-function-configuration \
  --function-name hedgehog-learn-dev-api \
  --region us-west-2 \
  > /tmp/lambda-config.json

# Update ENABLE_CRM_PROGRESS to true in the JSON

# Apply updated config
aws lambda update-function-configuration \
  --function-name hedgehog-learn-dev-api \
  --region us-west-2 \
  --environment Variables={ENABLE_CRM_PROGRESS=true,...} # Include all other vars
```

**Recommendation:** Use Option 1 (redeploy) to ensure consistency between code and deployment.

## After Enabling CRM Progress

### Step 1: Verify Lambda Configuration

```bash
aws lambda get-function-configuration \
  --function-name hedgehog-learn-dev-api \
  --region us-west-2 \
  | jq '.Environment.Variables.ENABLE_CRM_PROGRESS'
```

Should return: `"true"`

### Step 2: Re-run Dry-Run Tests

```bash
npx playwright test tests/api/membership-smoke.spec.ts --reporter=list
```

**Expected Results:**
```
✓  12 passed
```

### Step 3: Generate HTML Report

```bash
npx playwright test tests/api/membership-smoke.spec.ts --reporter=html
npx playwright show-report
```

### Step 4: Capture Verification Evidence

```bash
# Create timestamped directory
mkdir -p verification-output/issue-248/test-run-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# Copy results
cp -r playwright-report verification-output/issue-248/test-run-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)/

# Commit evidence
git add verification-output/issue-248/test-run-*
git commit -m "docs: Add successful test run evidence for Issue #248"
```

## Optional: Minor Code Fixes

The tests also identified two minor issues that can be addressed later:

### 1. Standardize Error Response Format

Some validation errors don't include the `code` field.

**File:** `src/api/lambda/index.ts`

**Fix:** Ensure all error responses include `code`:

```typescript
// Before:
return bad(400, 'Invalid payload', origin, { details: [...] });

// After:
return bad(400, 'Invalid payload', origin, {
  code: 'SCHEMA_VALIDATION_FAILED',
  details: [...]
});
```

### 2. Fix /enrollments/list Status Code

The `/enrollments/list` endpoint returns 401 when it should return 400 for missing parameters.

**File:** `src/api/lambda/index.ts`

**Fix:** Change validation error from 401 to 400:

```typescript
// Before:
return bad(401, 'Contact identifier required', origin);

// After:
return bad(400, 'Contact identifier required', origin, {
  code: 'MISSING_REQUIRED_PARAMETER'
});
```

**Note:** These are minor issues and don't block the test suite from being useful.

## GitHub Actions Verification

Once local tests pass:

### Step 1: Trigger Manual Workflow Run

1. Go to: **Actions** → **API Smoke Tests**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Select branch (main or your PR branch)
4. Click **Run workflow** button

### Step 2: Monitor Workflow

Watch for:
- ✅ `verify-endpoints` job passes (health checks)
- ✅ `api-smoke-tests` job passes (full suite)
- ✅ No failures or errors

### Step 3: Verify Nightly Schedule

The workflow is configured to run nightly at 2 AM UTC. After the first successful run, it will continue running automatically.

## Commit and Merge

Once tests pass locally and in CI/CD:

### Step 1: Review Changes

```bash
git status
```

Should show:
```
New files:
  tests/api/membership-smoke.spec.ts
  tests/api/helpers/hubspot-cleanup.ts
  tests/api/README.md
  .github/workflows/api-smoke-tests.yml
  verification-output/issue-248/

Modified files:
  docs/auth-and-progress.md
```

### Step 2: Create Commit

```bash
git add tests/api/ .github/workflows/api-smoke-tests.yml \
  verification-output/issue-248/ docs/auth-and-progress.md

git commit -m "feat: Add API-level membership smoke tests (Issue #248)

- Implement comprehensive Playwright test suite (13 scenarios)
- Add HubSpot CRM cleanup helper utilities
- Create GitHub Actions workflow (push, PR, nightly)
- Update documentation with testing instructions

Tests cover:
- Course and pathway enrollment flows
- Progress tracking and aggregation
- Anonymous vs authenticated behavior
- Error handling and validation

Resolves #248"
```

### Step 3: Create Pull Request

```bash
# Push to remote
git push origin your-branch-name

# Create PR (if using gh CLI)
gh pr create \
  --title "feat: Add API-level membership smoke tests (Issue #248)" \
  --body "$(cat verification-output/issue-248/IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md)" \
  --assignee @me
```

### Step 4: Monitor PR Checks

The GitHub Actions workflow will run automatically on the PR. Verify:
- ✅ All checks pass
- ✅ Tests complete successfully
- ✅ No linting errors

### Step 5: Merge

Once PR is approved and checks pass:
```bash
# Merge via GitHub UI or CLI
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch
```

## Post-Merge Monitoring

### Week 1: Active Monitoring

- Check nightly test runs daily
- Monitor for any flaky tests
- Adjust test timeouts if needed

### Week 2-4: Passive Monitoring

- Review weekly test results
- Address any failures promptly
- Add to release checklist

## Future Enhancements (Issue #242)

With API tests in place, you can confidently proceed with Issue #242:

**Goal:** Design & implement public-page authentication alternative

**Approach:**
1. OAuth proxy backed by HubSpot Project App
2. Signed JWT system for test environments
3. Update identity bootstrapper to support new auth

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks (per research in Issue #247)

**Benefits:**
- Full UI test automation
- Bypasses HubSpot membership CSRF
- API tests provide coverage during development
