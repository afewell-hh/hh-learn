## Key Improvements

### Before (JWT + Handshake)
```
User clicks CTA → Email prompt modal → JWT API call → Still need HubSpot password
```

### After (Native HubSpot)
```
User clicks CTA → Redirect to /_hcms/mem/login → HubSpot login → Return to page
```

### Benefits
- ✅ Simpler UX (no email prompt)
- ✅ Better security (HTTP-only cookies)
- ✅ More features (SSO, social login, 2FA)
- ✅ Less maintenance (HubSpot manages auth)
- ✅ Future-proof (aligned with HubSpot)
- ✅ Backward compatible (JWT for tests)

## Files Ready for Upload

All modified files are staged and ready for deployment:

```bash
# Modified files
M  clean-x-hedgehog-templates/assets/js/auth-context.js
M  clean-x-hedgehog-templates/assets/js/enrollment.js
M  clean-x-hedgehog-templates/learn/auth-handshake.html
M  clean-x-hedgehog-templates/learn/courses-page.html
M  clean-x-hedgehog-templates/learn/module-page.html
M  clean-x-hedgehog-templates/learn/my-learning.html
M  clean-x-hedgehog-templates/learn/pathways-page.html

# New files
??  clean-x-hedgehog-templates/assets/js/login-helper.js
```

**Important:** Template files have been automatically updated to include `login-helper.js` script reference. This was done by linter/formatter and is correct.

---

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Upload to HubSpot
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/afewell-hh/hh-learn
hs project upload
```

### Step 2: Verify Upload
Check that these files uploaded successfully:
- ✅ `assets/js/login-helper.js` (NEW)
- ✅ `assets/js/enrollment.js` (MODIFIED)
- ✅ `assets/js/auth-context.js` (MODIFIED)
- ✅ All template files (MODIFIED)

### Step 3: Quick Smoke Test
1. Visit a course page anonymously
2. Click "Sign in to start course"
3. Verify redirect to `/_hcms/mem/login`
4. Log in with test credentials
5. Verify return to course page
6. Check browser console for errors

### Step 4: Full Testing
Follow the comprehensive test plan: `verification-output/issue-272/TESTING-CHECKLIST.md`

---

## Testing Credentials

Use credentials from `.env` file:
- `HUBSPOT_TEST_EMAIL`
- `HUBSPOT_TEST_USERNAME`
- `HUBSPOT_TEST_PASSWORD`

---

## Automated Tests

### Run All Tests
```bash
# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install && npx playwright install

# Run enrollment flow test (with JWT helper - for automation)
npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/enrollment-flow.spec.ts

# Run membership smoke tests
npm run test:api -- tests/api/membership-smoke.spec.ts

# Run native login flow test (with real HubSpot login)
HUBSPOT_TEST_EMAIL=<value> HUBSPOT_TEST_PASSWORD=<value> \
npx playwright test tests/e2e/native-login-flow.spec.ts

# Run login and track test
npx playwright test tests/e2e/login-and-track.spec.ts
```

**Note:** Some tests may need updates to work with native login flow. JWT helper tests should still pass.

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise after deployment:

### Quick Rollback
1. Revert `enrollment.js` to restore `handleJWTLogin()`
2. Revert template files to restore `personalization_token()` usage
3. Run `hs project upload`

### Git Rollback
```bash
# Revert all changes
git checkout HEAD -- clean-x-hedgehog-templates/

# Re-upload
hs project upload
```
