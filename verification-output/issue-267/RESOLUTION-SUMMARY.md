# Issue #267: Resolution Summary

## Issue Description

**Title:** Fix auth-handshake redirect encoding on course CTA

**Problem:**
- After successful login from course/pathway pages, users were redirected to malformed URLs like `/learn/%2Flearn%2Fcourses/...`
- CTA buttons continued showing "Sign in" instead of updating to enrolled state
- Browser was sent to encoded URL strings instead of actual page paths

**Impact:**
- Blocked manual verification (Issue #266)
- Prevented enrollment CTAs from working correctly (Issues #226, #227, #230)
- Broke login flow for all course and pathway pages

## Root Cause

### Double URL Encoding
The login redirect flow uses double encoding by design:

1. **First encoding** (in `enrollment.js:69`):
   ```javascript
   var handshakeUrl = '/learn/auth-handshake?redirect_url=' +
                      encodeURIComponent(window.location.pathname + window.location.search);
   ```

2. **Second encoding** (in `enrollment.js:70`):
   ```javascript
   return base + separator + 'redirect_url=' + encodeURIComponent(handshakeUrl);
   ```

This creates URLs like:
```
/_hcms/mem/login?redirect_url=%2Flearn%2Fauth-handshake%3Fredirect_url%3D%252Flearn%252Fcourses%252Fkubernetes-basics
```

### Missing Decode in auth-handshake.html
The auth-handshake page was reading the `redirect_url` parameter without accounting for the double encoding:

```javascript
// BEFORE FIX (line 72)
var redirectUrl = urlParams.get('redirect_url') || '/learn';
// URLSearchParams.get() decodes ONCE automatically
// But the value is still encoded from the first encoding
```

**Result:** Browser tried to navigate to `/learn%2Fcourses%2Fkubernetes-basics` (literal string with %2F), which is not a valid route.

## Solution Implemented

### File Modified: `clean-x-hedgehog-templates/learn/auth-handshake.html`

**Change (lines 71-80):**
```javascript
var urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
var rawRedirectUrl = urlParams.get('redirect_url') || '/learn';

// Decode the redirect URL to handle double-encoding from login flow (Issue #267)
var redirectUrl = rawRedirectUrl;
try {
  redirectUrl = decodeURIComponent(rawRedirectUrl);
} catch (e) {
  console.warn('[auth-handshake] Failed to decode redirect_url, using raw value:', e);
}
```

**Why This Works:**
1. `URLSearchParams.get()` decodes once automatically: `/learn%2Fcourses%2Fkubernetes-basics`
2. `decodeURIComponent()` decodes again: `/learn/courses/kubernetes-basics` ✓
3. Browser navigates to the correct page
4. Page reloads with identity
5. CTA updates to enrolled state

**Safety Features:**
- Try/catch prevents crashes from malformed URLs
- Falls back to raw value if decode fails
- Default fallback to `/learn` if no redirect_url provided

## Why Not Change enrollment.js?

The double-encoding in `enrollment.js` is **correct by design**:

1. The HubSpot membership login system expects an encoded redirect URL
2. The handshake URL contains query parameters that need protection
3. Without outer encoding, the inner `?redirect_url=` would break the URL structure

Example:
```
❌ /_hcms/mem/login?redirect_url=/learn/auth-handshake?redirect_url=/learn/courses/foo
   (ambiguous - which redirect_url is which?)

✓ /_hcms/mem/login?redirect_url=%2Flearn%2Fauth-handshake%3Fredirect_url%3D%252Flearn%252Fcourses%252Ffoo
   (clear structure preserved)
```

## Testing

### Automated Test
Created `verification-output/issue-267/test-encoding-logic.js` to verify encoding/decoding logic.

**Test Results:**
```
✓ Course page without query params
✓ Pathway page with query params
✓ Course page with special characters
✓ Catalog page
✓ Course with fragment

All tests PASSED!
```

### Manual Testing Required
See `MANUAL-TESTING-GUIDE.md` for detailed manual testing steps.

**Key Scenarios to Test:**
1. Login from course page → redirect to same course (no %2F in URL)
2. Login from pathway page → redirect to same pathway
3. Login from catalog → redirect to catalog
4. Complex URLs with query params and fragments preserved

## Deployment Steps

1. **Upload Updated File to HubSpot**
   ```bash
   hs upload clean-x-hedgehog-templates/learn/auth-handshake.html
   ```
   Or upload via Design Manager UI

2. **Publish Changes**
   - Ensure the page is published in HubSpot
   - Clear CDN/browser cache if needed

3. **Manual Testing**
   - Follow steps in `MANUAL-TESTING-GUIDE.md`
   - Use test account: `afewell@gmail.com`
   - Test on course, pathway, and catalog pages

4. **Capture Verification Artifacts**
   - Screenshots of successful redirects
   - Browser console logs
   - Network tab captures
   - Save to `verification-output/issue-267/`

- [ ] CTA text flips from "Sign in" to "Start Course"/"Enroll" after the reload (manual test needed)
- [ ] Verification artifacts captured and linked from the issue (manual test needed)

## Next Steps

2. Perform manual testing following the guide
3. Capture verification screenshots and logs
4. Update this document with test results
5. Close Issue #267
6. Unblock and resume Issue #266 (manual verification)

## Notes

- This is a **client-side fix** - no serverless/Lambda changes needed
- The fix is **backward compatible** - won't break existing redirect flows
- The try/catch ensures **graceful degradation** if URLs are malformed
- The double-encoding pattern is **intentional and correct** in enrollment.js
