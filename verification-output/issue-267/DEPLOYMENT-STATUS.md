## Next Step: Publish the Page in HubSpot (Manual)

The template file has been uploaded to HubSpot's File Manager, but it needs to be **published as a page** to go live.

### Steps to Publish:

1. **Open HubSpot Design Manager:**
   - URL: https://app.hubspot.com/developer-projects/21430285/project/hedgehog-learn-dev
   - Or run: `hs project open`

2. **Navigate to the Template:**
   - Go to: Marketing → Files and Templates → Design Manager
   - Find: `CLEAN x HEDGEHOG/templates/learn/auth-handshake.html`

3. **Check Page Status:**
   - If the page exists at `/learn/auth-handshake`, find it in:
     - Marketing → Website → Website Pages
     - Search for "auth-handshake"

4. **Publish the Page:**
   - If page is in "Draft" status, click "Publish" button
   - If page doesn't exist yet, create a new page using the template:
     - Click "Create" → "Website Page"
     - Select the auth-handshake.html template
     - Set URL: `/learn/auth-handshake`
     - Set as Private page (requires login)
     - Click "Publish"

## Verification After Publishing

Once the page is published, verify the fix is live:

### Test 1: Check Source Code
```bash
curl -s "https://hedgehog.cloud/learn/auth-handshake" | grep "decodeURIComponent"
```

**Expected:** Should find the decodeURIComponent logic in the JavaScript

### Test 2: Test Login Redirect
1. Go to: https://hedgehog.cloud/learn/courses/course-authoring-101 (not logged in)
2. Click "Sign in to start course"
3. Complete login with `afewell@gmail.com` / `Ar7far7!`
4. **Check final URL after redirect**
   - ✅ **SUCCESS:** `/learn/courses/course-authoring-101` (clean URL)
   - ❌ **FAILED:** `/learn%2Fcourses%2Fcourse-authoring-101` (still encoded)

### Test 3: Check Browser Console
After login redirect, open DevTools Console:
```javascript
// Should see:
[auth-handshake] Identity stored: {hasEmail: true, hasContactId: true}
[auth-handshake] Redirecting to: /learn/courses/course-authoring-101
```

### Test 4: Verify CTA Updates
After redirect, the CTA button should:
- ✅ Change from "Sign in to start course" to "Start Course" or "✓ Enrolled"
- ✅ Be in the correct color (blue for enroll, green for enrolled)
- ✅ Be clickable (if not enrolled) or disabled (if enrolled)

## Troubleshooting

### If URL Still Contains %2F After Publishing:

1. **Clear CDN Cache:**
   - HubSpot may cache templates
   - Try: `https://hedgehog.cloud/learn/auth-handshake?hs_no_cache=1`

2. **Hard Refresh:**
   - Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux)
   - Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

3. **Check Page Settings:**
   - Verify the page is using the correct template
   - Check if template has been saved and published

4. **View Source:**
   - Right-click → View Page Source
   - Search for "decodeURIComponent"
   - If not found, template hasn't been applied

### If CTA Doesn't Update:

1. **Check Identity Storage:**
   ```javascript
   // Browser console
   sessionStorage.getItem('hhl_identity')
   ```
   Should return JSON with email and contactId

2. **Check Enrollment.js Loading:**
   ```javascript
   // Browser console
   typeof window.hhInitEnrollment
   ```
   Should return "function"

3. **Check for JavaScript Errors:**
   - Open DevTools Console
   - Look for red error messages
