## Issue Overview

**Problem:** Login redirects from course/pathway pages were sending users to malformed URLs like `/learn/%2Flearn%2Fcourses/...`, causing CTA buttons to remain stuck on "Sign in" even after successful authentication.

**Root Cause:** Double URL encoding in the login flow, with missing decode in auth-handshake.html.

**Solution:** Added explicit `decodeURIComponent()` call in auth-handshake.html to properly decode the double-encoded redirect URL.
