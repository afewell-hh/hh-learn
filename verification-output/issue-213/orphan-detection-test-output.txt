Test: Orphan Detection Error Handling
=====================================

This test demonstrates that the validation system correctly detects and reports
orphaned references with clear, actionable error messages.

Test Setup
----------
Created a temporary course file with intentional orphaned references:
- 2 invalid modules in the modules array
- 1 invalid module_ref in content_blocks

Test Execution
--------------
Command: npm run sync:courses -- --dry-run

Actual Output
-------------

❌ VALIDATION FAILED: Found orphaned references


  COURSE: test-orphan-detection
    ✗ Missing module "non-existent-module" in modules array
    ✗ Missing module "another-missing-module" in modules array
    ✗ Missing reference "invalid-content-block-ref" in content_blocks[0]


💡 Fix these issues before syncing:
   1. Create the missing modules/courses, OR
   2. Remove the invalid references from the JSON files

❌ Sync failed: Error: Validation failed: Found 3 orphaned reference(s). Fix these issues before syncing.


Test Results
------------
✅ Validation correctly identified all 3 orphaned references
✅ Error message includes parent type and slug (COURSE: test-orphan-detection)
✅ Error message includes location of each invalid reference
✅ Error message provides actionable guidance (create missing content or remove references)
✅ Sync was blocked before attempting any HubDB operations
✅ Exit code indicates failure (non-zero)

Conclusion
----------
The orphan detection system functions as designed:
- Fails fast before publishing
- Provides clear, detailed error messages
- Includes exact location of each problem
- Offers actionable remediation steps
- Prevents data corruption in HubDB
