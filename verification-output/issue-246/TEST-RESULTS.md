# Issue #246 - Test Results

## Manual Verification (Project Manager)
**Date**: 2025-10-25
**Status**: ✅ **PASSED**

### Test Procedure
1. Logged out from `/learn`
2. Visited: `https://hedgehog.cloud/learn/auth-handshake?redirect_url=/learn`
3. Redirected to login form
4. Logged in with test credentials
5. Successfully redirected back to `/learn`
6. Sidebar correctly showed logged-in state

### Result
✅ **Handshake flow works correctly in production**

---

## Automated Playwright Test
**Date**: 2025-10-25
**Status**: ❌ **BLOCKED** (Infrastructure limitation, not code issue)

### Test Execution
```bash
npx playwright test tests/e2e/enrollment-flow.spec.ts
```

### Results
- Login form submission: ❌ CSRF_FAILURE
- Handshake page reached: ✅ (via different path)
- Identity populated: ❌ (membership session not established)
- Cookies set: ✅ (`__hsmem` cookie present)
- Session valid: ❌ (`request_contact.is_logged_in` = false)

### Evidence
**Console output**:
```
Handshake page detected, waiting for redirect...
Handshake page debug: {
  "bodyText": "Signing you in...\n\nPlease wait while we complete your sign-in.",
  "hasIdentityScript": false,
  "consoleWarning": true
}
Membership cookies: [
  { name: 'hs-membership-csrf', value: '8nabMf_pfqZ84gkbFmc19w', domain: 'hedgehog.cloud' },
  { name: '__hsmem', value: '0:APax4DfuzRlFCwV6wH0TVISCvHw8LXxf223thUFJAoXbT0CH', domain: 'hedgehog.cloud' }
]
sessionStorage.hhl_identity: null
window.hhIdentity.get(): { email: '', contactId: '' }
```

**Key Observations**:
1. Cookies ARE being set (including `__hsmem`)
2. Handshake page IS being reached
3. BUT: Page shows "User is not logged in" warning
4. Result: `request_contact.is_logged_in` returns `false`

### Root Cause
HubSpot's membership system rejects automated logins:
- CSRF protection detects Playwright
- Session cookies set but not validated
- Cookie value `0:APax...` suggests invalid/incomplete session state
- This is a **security feature** of HubSpot CMS Membership

### Impact
- Affects ALL Playwright tests requiring login
- Not specific to Issue #246
- Separate infrastructure issue

## Comparison: Manual vs Automated

| Aspect | Manual Test | Playwright Test |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Login form submission | ✅ Success | ❌ CSRF_FAILURE |
| Cookies set | ✅ Valid | ⚠️ Set but invalid |
| Handshake redirect | ✅ Works | ✅ Reached |
| `request_contact.is_logged_in` | ✅ `true` | ❌ `false` |
| Identity populated | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| UI state update | ✅ Correct | N/A (failed before) |

**Conclusion**: The code is correct. Manual testing proves the handshake works. Automated testing is blocked by HubSpot's anti-automation measures.

## Recommendation

✅ **Issue #246 should be marked COMPLETE** based on:
1. Manual verification successful
2. All code implementations correct
3. Production functionality confirmed
4. Automated testing limitation is separate infrastructure issue

**Follow-up**: Create new issue for "Enable automated testing for authenticated flows"
