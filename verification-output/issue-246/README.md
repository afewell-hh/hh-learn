## Status Summary

**Overall Status**: üî¥ **Blocked**

**Blocking Issue**: Handshake page (`/learn/auth-handshake`) must be configured as Private Content in HubSpot CMS

**Work Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Code review of all components (handshake, identity bootstrapper, action runner, enrollment)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced Playwright test with comprehensive verification
- ‚úÖ Updated documentation with configuration checklist
- ‚úÖ Created detailed findings and summary documents
- ‚úÖ Posted summary to GitHub issue

**Pending**:
- ‚è≥ HubSpot CMS configuration verification
- ‚è≥ Passing Playwright test run
- ‚è≥ Manual browser verification
- ‚è≥ Final screenshot artifacts

## Test Execution

### Current Test Run
```bash
npx playwright test tests/e2e/enrollment-flow.spec.ts
```

**Result**: Failed at identity verification (sessionStorage is null)

**Console Output**:
```
Handshake page detected, waiting for redirect...
sessionStorage.hhl_identity: null
window.hhIdentity.get(): { email: '', contactId: '' }
```

### After HubSpot Configuration
Once the handshake page is configured as Private Content, re-run the test:

```bash
# Run test
npx playwright test tests/e2e/enrollment-flow.spec.ts

# View trace (if test fails)
npx playwright show-trace test-results/[test-path]/trace.zip

# View screenshots (after test completes)
ls -la verification-output/issue-246/*.png
cat verification-output/issue-246/test-report.json
```

## Configuration Checklist

Required HubSpot CMS configuration for `/learn/auth-handshake`:

1. Navigate to: Marketing ‚Üí Website ‚Üí Website Pages
2. Find: "Auth Handshake (Private)" at `/learn/auth-handshake`
3. Settings ‚Üí Advanced Options ‚Üí Content Access
4. Set: "Private - registration required"
5. Access Group: Assign group containing test user
6. Publish: Ensure page is published (not draft)

## Manual Verification

After HubSpot configuration:

```bash
# 1. Visit handshake URL while signed in
# https://hedgehog.cloud/learn/auth-handshake?redirect_url=/learn

# 2. After redirect, open DevTools Console and run:
console.log(sessionStorage.getItem('hhl_identity'));
console.log(window.hhIdentity.get());

# Expected output:
# { email: "afewell@gmail.com", contactId: "...", firstname: "...", lastname: "...", timestamp: "..." }
```
