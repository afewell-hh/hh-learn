# HubSpot Configuration Verification - Issue #246

## Auth Handshake Page Configuration Check

**Date**: 2025-10-25

### Page URL
`https://hedgehog.cloud/learn/auth-handshake`

### Configuration Requirements
The handshake page MUST be configured as **Private Content** in HubSpot CMS for the identity capture to work.

### Verification Method
HTTP request to the handshake page while not authenticated:

```bash
curl -I "https://hedgehog.cloud/learn/auth-handshake"
```

### Expected Response
- **HTTP Status**: 307 (Temporary Redirect)
- **Location Header**: Should redirect to `/_hcms/mem/login`
- **x-hs-content-membership-redirect Header**: Should be present

### Actual Response
```
HTTP/2 307
location: https://hedgehog.cloud/_hcms/mem/login?redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fhedgehog.cloud%2Flearn%2Fauth-handshake
x-hs-content-membership-redirect: true
```

### Verification Result
✅ **CONFIRMED**: The handshake page IS properly configured as Private Content

**Evidence**:
1. ✅ Returns 307 redirect (not 200 public page)
2. ✅ Redirects to membership login
3. ✅ Header `x-hs-content-membership-redirect: true` confirms private page

### Manual Verification (by PM)
✅ **CONFIRMED**: PM tested the handshake flow manually:
- Logged out state → redirected to login ✅
- Logged in → handshake captured identity ✅
- Redirected back to original page ✅
- UI updated to show logged-in state ✅

### Conclusion
The HubSpot "Auth Handshake (Private)" page configuration is **CORRECT** and working as expected.

Both automated and manual verification paths confirm the page is properly configured as "Private - registration required."

## Action Runner Page Configuration

**Page URL**: `https://hedgehog.cloud/learn/action-runner`

**Expected**: Should also be Private Content

**Verification**:
```bash
curl -I "https://hedgehog.cloud/learn/action-runner"
```

### Result
```
HTTP/2 307
location: https://hedgehog.cloud/_hcms/mem/login?redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fhedgehog.cloud%2Flearn%2Faction-runner
x-hs-content-membership-redirect: true
```

✅ **CONFIRMED**: Action runner is also properly configured as Private Content

---

## Summary

Both critical private pages are correctly configured:

1. ✅ `/learn/auth-handshake` - Private ✅
2. ✅ `/learn/action-runner` - Private ✅

This configuration allows:
- Identity capture via `request_contact` on handshake page
- Secure action processing with user context on action-runner page
- Proper redirect flow for authentication

**No configuration changes needed.**
