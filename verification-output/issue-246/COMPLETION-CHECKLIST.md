## Blocking Issue

**Status**: üî¥ **BLOCKED**

**Issue**: Handshake page must be configured as Private Content in HubSpot CMS

**Owner**: Project owner with HubSpot CMS access

**Required Action**: Configure `/learn/auth-handshake` as Private Content
1. HubSpot ‚Üí Marketing ‚Üí Website ‚Üí Website Pages
2. Find "Auth Handshake (Private)" at `/learn/auth-handshake`
3. Settings ‚Üí Advanced Options ‚Üí Content Access
4. Set: "Private - registration required"
5. Access Group: Assign group with test user
6. Publish page

**After Resolution**: Re-run `npx playwright test tests/e2e/enrollment-flow.spec.ts`

## Completion Criteria

### To Mark This Issue as Complete
All items must be checked:

- [ ] Handshake page verified/configured as Private in HubSpot CMS
- [ ] Playwright test passes all assertions
- [ ] sessionStorage.hhl_identity populated after login
- [ ] window.hhIdentity.get() returns correct identity
- [ ] Enrollment action completes successfully
- [ ] My Learning dashboard shows enrolled course
- [ ] All 5 screenshots generated and saved
- [ ] test-report.json generated with passing assertions
- [ ] "Last verified" date added to docs/auth-and-progress.md
- [ ] Final GitHub comment posted with passing results

### Current Status
**7 of 14 deliverables complete** (50%)
**All code work complete** (100%)
**Configuration/deployment work pending** (0%)

## Recommendations

### Immediate
1. **Verify HubSpot configuration** - Project owner should confirm handshake page settings
2. **Re-run test** - After configuration confirmed
3. **Manual verification** - Follow steps in docs/auth-and-progress.md
4. **Update issue** - Add final comment with passing results

### Short-term
1. Add diagnostic logging to handshake (query param controlled)
2. Create health check for handshake page configuration
3. Add CI check that validates handshake is private
4. Document manual verification procedure in runbook

### Long-term
1. Implement Issue #242 (public-page auth alternative)
2. Reduce dependency on HubSpot Membership
3. Add monitoring for auth flow health
