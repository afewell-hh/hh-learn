# Phase 3: JWT Authentication Test Updates - Summary

**Issue**: #253
**Related Issues**: #242 (Public-page authentication), #251 (JWT implementation)
**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Tests Updated, Ready for Execution

---

## Overview

This document summarizes the completion of **Phase 3** from the JWT authentication implementation plan (Issue #242). Phase 3 focuses on updating automated tests to use the new JWT authentication flow that was implemented and merged in PR #252.

---

## What Was Completed

### 1. Updated Playwright E2E Test (`tests/e2e/enrollment-flow.spec.ts`)

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Renamed test suite from "Course enrollment flow with handshake (Issue #246)" to "Course enrollment flow with JWT auth (Issue #242 - Phase 3)"
- ✅ Added `authenticateViaJWT()` helper function that:
  - Calls `/auth/login` endpoint with email
  - Stores JWT token in localStorage (`hhl_auth_token`)
  - Stores identity in localStorage (`hhl_identity_from_jwt`)
- ✅ Replaced handshake login flow with JWT authentication
- ✅ Updated test flow to:
  1. Visit public course page (anonymous)
  2. Authenticate via JWT
  3. Reload page to trigger identity resolution
  4. Verify CTA changes from "Sign in" to "Start Course"
  5. Enroll in course
  6. Verify enrollment persists
  7. Check My Learning page shows enrolled course
- ✅ Updated verification directory to `verification-output/issue-242/`
- ✅ Added JWT-specific network call tracking
- ✅ Enhanced test report with JWT authentication details

**Key Improvements:**
- No longer requires HubSpot membership login (which was blocked by CSRF)
- Works on public pages without membership session
- Tests actual production JWT authentication flow
- Captures comprehensive verification artifacts

### 2. Updated API Smoke Tests (`tests/api/membership-smoke.spec.ts`)

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Renamed test suite to "Membership API Smoke Tests with JWT"
- ✅ Added `getJWTToken()` helper function for obtaining JWT tokens
- ✅ Added new test group: "JWT Authentication" with 3 tests:
  - ✅ Valid JWT token authentication
  - ✅ Invalid email format rejection
  - ✅ Non-existent email rejection
- ✅ Updated all authenticated API tests to use JWT Authorization header:
  - Course enrollment flow (3 tests)
  - Pathway enrollment flow (2 tests)
  - Progress aggregation (2 tests)
  - Authenticated behavior test
  - Error handling tests (3 tests)
- ✅ Removed dependency on `HUBSPOT_TEST_CONTACT_ID` (no longer needed)
- ✅ Removed explicit `contactIdentifier` from request payloads (JWT provides identity)
- ✅ Updated all `/enrollments/list` and `/progress/read` calls to use Authorization header instead of query params

**Test Coverage:**
- **Total Tests**: 15
- **JWT Authentication**: 3 tests
- **Course Enrollment**: 3 tests
- **Pathway Enrollment**: 2 tests
- **Progress Aggregation**: 2 tests
- **Anonymous vs Authenticated**: 2 tests
- **Error Handling**: 3 tests

**Key Improvements:**
- All authenticated tests now use JWT instead of explicit email/contactId
- Tests verify backward compatibility (anonymous events still work)
- Error handling covers JWT validation failures
- No longer requires HubSpot membership session

## Test Execution Requirements

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables must be set to run the tests:

```bash
# Required
HUBSPOT_TEST_USERNAME=<valid-crm-contact-email>  # e.g., test@example.com
JWT_SECRET=<jwt-signing-secret>                   # Must match Lambda JWT_SECRET

# Optional (override defaults)
API_BASE_URL=https://hvoog2lnha.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
COURSE_SLUG=course-authoring-101
COURSE_URL=https://hedgehog.cloud/learn/courses/course-authoring-101
```

### Running the Tests

#### API Smoke Tests

```bash
# Run all API smoke tests
npx playwright test tests/api/membership-smoke.spec.ts

# Run specific test group
npx playwright test tests/api/membership-smoke.spec.ts -g "JWT Authentication"

# Run with verbose output
npx playwright test tests/api/membership-smoke.spec.ts --reporter=list
```

#### E2E Enrollment Flow Test

```bash
# Run E2E test
npx playwright test tests/e2e/enrollment-flow.spec.ts

# Run with headed browser (see UI)
npx playwright test tests/e2e/enrollment-flow.spec.ts --headed

# Run with debug mode
npx playwright test tests/e2e/enrollment-flow.spec.ts --debug
```

#### Run All Tests

```bash
# Run both API and E2E tests
npx playwright test tests/api/membership-smoke.spec.ts tests/e2e/enrollment-flow.spec.ts
```

## Verification Artifacts

When tests run successfully, they will generate the following artifacts in `verification-output/issue-242/`:

### E2E Test Artifacts

1. **Screenshots:**
   - `1-anonymous-state.png` - Course page before authentication
   - `2-authenticated-via-jwt.png` - Course page after JWT login
   - `3-post-enrollment.png` or `3-already-enrolled.png` - After enrollment
   - `4-my-learning.png` - My Learning page showing enrolled course

2. **Test Report:**
   - `e2e-test-report.json` - Detailed test results including:
     - Test user email
     - Course slug
     - JWT token storage verification
     - Identity resolution details
     - Network call logs
     - All test assertions

### API Test Artifacts

1. **Test Output:**
   - `api-smoke-test-output.log` - Complete test execution log
   - Playwright HTML report (if configured)

2. **Trace Files:**
   - Playwright trace files in `test-results/` (for debugging failures)

## Test Changes Summary

### Before (Legacy Approach)
- E2E test used HubSpot membership login with username/password
- Required handshake page redirect
- Failed due to CSRF protection on automated logins
- API tests used explicit `contactIdentifier: { email, contactId }` in payloads
- Required test contact ID in environment

### After (JWT Approach)
- E2E test uses `/auth/login` endpoint with email only
- No password required (email-only authentication)
- Works on public pages without membership session
- API tests use `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- Contact identity automatically extracted from JWT
- More secure and production-realistic

---

## Test Scenarios Covered

### ✅ Anonymous User Flow
1. Visit public course page
2. See "Sign in to start course" CTA
3. No enrollment or progress data

### ✅ JWT Authentication Flow
1. Call `/auth/login` with email
2. Receive JWT token (24h expiry)
3. Token stored in localStorage
4. Identity available via `window.hhIdentity.get()`

### ✅ Authenticated User Flow
1. JWT token in localStorage
2. Identity resolved on page load
3. CTA shows "Start Course" or "Enroll"
4. Can enroll in courses/pathways
5. Progress tracking persists to CRM
6. Enrollments visible on My Learning page

### ✅ Error Handling
1. Invalid email format → 400 error
2. Non-existent email → 404 error
3. Invalid JWT token → Falls back to anonymous
4. Missing required fields → 400 error with validation details

### ✅ Backward Compatibility
1. Anonymous events still work without JWT
2. Explicit email/contactId in payload still supported (deprecated but functional)
3. Existing frontend code unchanged

---

## Known Limitations

### Current Test Environment
- **Tests are skipped** if `HUBSPOT_TEST_USERNAME` is not set
- **JWT_SECRET must match** the Lambda environment variable
- Tests require valid HubSpot CRM contact to exist
- Tests run against production API (no mock/stub implementation)

### Future Enhancements
1. Add mock API server for local testing (no CRM dependency)
2. Add test for JWT token expiry and refresh
3. Add test for logout flow (clear localStorage)
4. Add test for concurrent sessions across devices
5. Add performance benchmarks (JWT vs membership session)

---

**Summary**: Phase 3 test updates are **complete and ready for execution**. All tests have been successfully migrated from HubSpot membership authentication to JWT authentication. Tests require valid environment variables (`HUBSPOT_TEST_USERNAME`, `JWT_SECRET`) to run. Once credentials are configured, tests can be executed to verify the JWT authentication flow works end-to-end.
