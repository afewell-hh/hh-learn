# Issue #266: Automated Tests Complete, Ready for Manual UI Verification

## Status: ✅ Automated Backend Verified | ⏸️ Awaiting Manual UI Testing

### What's Been Completed

#### 1. Prerequisite: Issue #267 Fixed and Deployed ✅
The auth-handshake redirect encoding bug has been fixed and deployed to production (Build #25). This was the blocking issue for manual verification.

**What was fixed:**
- Double URL encoding in login redirects causing malformed URLs (`/learn/%2Flearn%2Fcourses/...`)
- Added `decodeURIComponent()` in auth-handshake.html to properly decode redirect URLs
- CTA buttons should now update correctly after login

**Documentation:**
- Full analysis: `verification-output/issue-267/`
- Commit: f025fe7

#### 2. Automated API Verification ✅
Created and ran comprehensive backend tests:

```bash
./verification-output/issue-266/automated-api-verification.sh
```

**Results:**
- ✓ Authentication (POST /auth/login): Working
- ✓ Enrollments (GET /enrollments/list): Working (1 course, 1 pathway)
- ✓ Progress (GET /progress/read): Working
- ✓ Aggregate (GET /progress/aggregate): Working
- ✓ Event Tracking (POST /events/track): Working

All API endpoints verified functional. Backend is ready for UI testing.

#### 3. Testing Infrastructure Created ✅
Comprehensive manual testing materials prepared:

**Documentation:**
- `README.md` - Complete testing guide
- `AI-LIMITATIONS-NOTE.md` - Explains what requires human testing
- `MANUAL-TEST-RESULTS-TEMPLATE.md` - Form for recording test results
- `PROGRESS-SUMMARY.md` - Current status and timeline

**Automation:**
- `automated-api-verification.sh` - Backend verification script
- API test results in `automated-tests/` directory
- JWT token saved for manual API testing

### What Requires Manual Testing (Human)

Issue #266 requires **manual UI interaction** that AI cannot perform:

#### 6 Test Scenarios Required:

1. **Test 1: Anonymous Course Page**
   - Verify CTA shows "Sign in to start course"
   - Screenshot required

2. **Test 2: Anonymous Pathway Page**
   - Verify CTA shows "Sign in to enroll"
   - Screenshot required

3. **Test 3: Login Redirect Flow** ⭐ **CRITICAL**
   - **This verifies Issue #267 fix in production**
   - Click "Sign in" → Complete login → Verify redirect
   - **Expected:** Clean URL like `/learn/courses/course-authoring-101`
   - **Failed if:** URL contains `%2F` like `/learn%2Fcourses%2F...`
   - **Expected:** CTA updates from "Sign in" to enrolled state
   - 3 screenshots required (before, during, after)

4. **Test 4: Authenticated Enrollment**
   - Test enrollment flow when logged in
   - 2 screenshots required

5. **Test 5: CRM State Synchronization**
   - Verify enrolled state loads from CRM
   - Screenshot + network request required

6. **Test 6: My Learning Dashboard**
   - Verify progress display and Continue CTAs
   - 2 screenshots required

**Total artifacts needed:**
- Minimum 8 screenshots
- Console logs from browser DevTools
- Network requests for key API calls

### How to Perform Manual Testing

#### Quick Start:
1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Browser (Chrome/Firefox/Safari)
   - Test account: `afewell@gmail.com` / `Ar7far7!`
   - Screenshot tool
   - 30-45 minutes

2. **Follow the guide:**
   ```
   verification-output/issue-266/README.md
   ```

3. **Record results in:**
   ```
   verification-output/issue-266/MANUAL-TEST-RESULTS-TEMPLATE.md
   ```

4. **Save artifacts to:**
   ```
   verification-output/issue-266/manual-tests/
   ```

#### Detailed Instructions:
See: `verification-output/issue-230/MANUAL-TESTING-GUIDE.md`

### Success Criteria

Issue #266 can be closed when:

- [x] Issue #267 deployed (auth-handshake fix)
- [x] Automated API tests pass
- [ ] **Test 3 passes** (no %2F in redirect URL) ← CRITICAL for Issue #267 verification
- [ ] All 6 manual UI tests documented
- [ ] Screenshots captured (8 minimum)
- [ ] Console logs show no errors
- [ ] CTA states verified visually
- [ ] Results posted to GitHub

### Impact on Related Issues

This verification unblocks:
- **Issue #226** (Course CTA enrollment) - Waiting on #266
- **Issue #227** (Pathway CTA enrollment) - Waiting on #266
- **Issue #230** (Public login alternative) - Waiting on #266

And confirms:
- **Issue #267** (Auth-handshake redirect fix) - Verification pending manual Test 3

### Git Commits

- `f025fe7` - fix: Decode redirect_url in auth-handshake (Issue #267)
- `b601cc1` - docs: Add README and GitHub comment for Issue #267
- `6869a45` - feat: Add automated tests and manual testing infrastructure (Issue #266)

### Next Steps

**For the human tester:**
1. Review `verification-output/issue-266/README.md`
2. Run the 6 manual test scenarios
3. Capture screenshots and logs
4. Fill in `MANUAL-TEST-RESULTS-TEMPLATE.md`
5. Report back on this issue with results

**After manual testing:**
- If all tests pass → Close #266, #267, and unblock #226, #227, #230
- If tests fail → Document failures and create follow-up issues
