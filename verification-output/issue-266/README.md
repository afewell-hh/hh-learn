### What Needs Manual Testing (Human Required)

Issue #266 requires **manual UI interaction** that cannot be automated by AI:

1. **Login Redirect Flow** (Issue #267 verification)
   - Click buttons on live site
   - Verify redirect URLs in browser
   - Check for encoded characters (%2F)
   - Capture screenshots

2. **CTA Button States**
   - Verify visual appearance
   - Check button text changes
   - Confirm colors and styling
   - Test click interactions

3. **Browser Session Management**
   - Log in via HubSpot membership UI
   - Verify cookies and session storage
   - Check identity persistence
   - Monitor browser console logs

4. **Visual Verification**
   - My Learning dashboard layout
   - Progress indicators
   - Toast notifications
   - Responsive design

## Quick Start for Manual Testing

### Prerequisites
- Browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari)
- Test account: `afewell@gmail.com` / `Ar7far7!`
- Screenshot tool
- 30-45 minutes

### Step 1: Run Automated API Tests (Optional)
```bash
./verification-output/issue-266/automated-api-verification.sh
```

This verifies the backend is working before UI testing.

### Step 2: Follow Manual Testing Guide
Open and follow:
```
verification-output/issue-230/MANUAL-TESTING-GUIDE.md
```

6 test scenarios to complete (see below).

### Step 3: Record Results
Fill in the template:
```
verification-output/issue-266/MANUAL-TEST-RESULTS-TEMPLATE.md
```

### Step 4: Capture Artifacts
Save to `verification-output/issue-266/manual-tests/`:
- Screenshots (minimum 8 required)
- Console logs (`console-logs.txt`)
- Network requests (`network-requests.txt`)

### Step 5: Report Back
Post results in Issue #266 or provide to project maintainer.

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Anonymous Course Page
Verify CTA shows "Sign in to start course" for non-logged-in users.

### Test 2: Anonymous Pathway Page
Verify CTA shows "Sign in to enroll" for non-logged-in users.

### Test 3: Login Redirect Flow ⭐ CRITICAL
**This is the primary test for Issue #267 fix.**

Steps:
1. Start on course page (not logged in)
2. Click "Sign in to start course"
3. Complete login
4. **Verify final URL is clean** (no `%2F` sequences)
5. **Verify CTA updates** to enrolled state

Expected: `/learn/courses/course-authoring-101`
Failed: `/learn%2Fcourses%2Fcourse-authoring-101` (still encoded)

### Test 4: Authenticated Enrollment
Verify enrollment flow when logged in but not enrolled.

### Test 5: CRM State Synchronization
Verify button reflects enrolled state from CRM on page load.

### Test 6: My Learning Dashboard
Verify progress display and Continue CTAs.
