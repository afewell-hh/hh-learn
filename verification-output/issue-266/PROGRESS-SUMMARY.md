# Issue #266: Progress Summary

## Current Status: Ready for Manual UI Testing

### Completed Tasks ✅

#### 1. Issue #267 Resolution (Prerequisite)
- **Problem:** Login redirects from course/pathway pages were sending users to malformed URLs with `%2F` encoding
- **Solution:** Added `decodeURIComponent()` in auth-handshake.html to handle double-encoded redirect URLs
- **Deployment:** Successfully deployed to HubSpot (Build #25)
- **Files Modified:**
  - `clean-x-hedgehog-templates/learn/auth-handshake.html` (lines 71-80)
- **Verification:**
  - Encoding/decoding logic tested
  - Automated tests created
  - Manual testing guide prepared

#### 2. Automated API Verification
- **Script Created:** `automated-api-verification.sh`
- **Tests Run:** All 5 API endpoints verified
- **Results:** All endpoints working correctly ✓
  - Authentication (POST /auth/login): PASS
  - Enrollments (GET /enrollments/list): PASS
  - Progress (GET /progress/read): PASS
  - Aggregate (GET /progress/aggregate): PASS
  - Event Tracking (POST /events/track): PASS
- **Data:**
  - JWT token generated successfully
  - User enrolled in 1 course, 1 pathway
  - Progress tracking functional
  - Results saved to `automated-tests/`

#### 3. Testing Infrastructure
- **Created Files:**
  - `README.md` - Complete guide for manual testing
  - `AI-LIMITATIONS-NOTE.md` - What AI can/cannot do
  - `MANUAL-TEST-RESULTS-TEMPLATE.md` - Form for recording results
  - `automated-api-verification.sh` - Backend verification script
  - `PROGRESS-SUMMARY.md` - This file

- **Documentation:**
  - Issue #267 resolution docs (7 files)
  - Manual testing guides
  - API verification results
  - Result capture templates

### Pending Tasks (Requires Human)

#### Manual UI Testing
The following tests require human interaction with a web browser:

1. **Test 1: Anonymous Course Page**
   - Verify CTA visibility and text
   - Capture screenshot

2. **Test 2: Anonymous Pathway Page**
   - Verify CTA visibility and text
   - Capture screenshot

3. **Test 3: Login Redirect Flow** ⭐ **CRITICAL**
   - Click login button from course page
   - Complete HubSpot membership login
   - **Verify final URL has no %2F encoding**
   - **Verify CTA updates to enrolled state**
   - Capture 3 screenshots (before, during, after)
   - This test verifies Issue #267 fix

4. **Test 4: Authenticated Enrollment**
   - Test enrollment flow when logged in
   - Verify button state changes
   - Capture before/after screenshots

5. **Test 5: CRM State Synchronization**
   - Clear localStorage
   - Verify enrolled state loads from CRM
   - Capture screenshot + network request

6. **Test 6: My Learning Dashboard**
   - Verify progress display
   - Check nested course/module listings
   - Capture 2 screenshots

#### Artifact Capture
- Screenshots: Minimum 8 required
- Console logs: From browser DevTools
- Network requests: Key API calls
- Save to: `verification-output/issue-266/manual-tests/`

## Why Manual Testing is Required

AI assistants **cannot**:
- Open web browsers
- Click buttons on live websites
- Capture screenshots
- View visual styles (colors, fonts, layouts)
- Navigate through HubSpot membership login
- Access browser DevTools
- Verify real user experience

See `AI-LIMITATIONS-NOTE.md` for details.

## What Has Been Automated

✅ Backend API verification (all endpoints working)
✅ JWT authentication testing
✅ Enrollment state queries
✅ Progress tracking validation
✅ Event tracking submission
✅ Code analysis and fixes
✅ Documentation creation
✅ Test infrastructure setup

## How to Proceed

### For Human Testers:

1. **Review Prerequisites:**
   ```
   - Browser ready
   - Test account: afewell@gmail.com / Ar7far7!
   - Screenshot tool
   - 30-45 minutes available
   ```

2. **Run Automated Tests (Optional):**
   ```bash
   ./verification-output/issue-266/automated-api-verification.sh
   ```
   Confirms backend is working.

3. **Follow Manual Testing Guide:**
   ```
   verification-output/issue-230/MANUAL-TESTING-GUIDE.md
   ```

4. **Record Results:**
   ```
   verification-output/issue-266/MANUAL-TEST-RESULTS-TEMPLATE.md
   ```

5. **Capture Artifacts:**
   - Save screenshots to `manual-tests/`
   - Copy console logs
   - Copy network requests

6. **Report Findings:**
   - Update MANUAL-TEST-RESULTS-TEMPLATE.md
   - Post summary on Issue #266
   - Close issues if all tests pass

## Success Criteria

Issue #266 can be closed when:

- [x] Issue #267 deployed (auth-handshake fix)
- [x] Automated API tests pass
- [ ] **Test 3 passes** (no %2F in redirect URL) ← CRITICAL
- [ ] All 6 manual UI tests documented
- [ ] Screenshots captured (8 minimum)
- [ ] Console logs show no errors
- [ ] CTA states verified visually
- [ ] Results posted to GitHub

## Expected Outcomes

### If All Tests Pass ✅

**Issue #267:** Close as verified
- Redirect URLs are clean (no encoding)
- CTA buttons update after login
- Identity persists correctly

**Issue #266:** Close as complete
- Manual UI verification successful
- All test scenarios passed
- Artifacts captured and documented

**Issues #226, #227, #230:** Update as unblocked
- These issues were waiting for #266 completion
- Can now proceed to closure

### If Tests Fail ❌

1. Document which test failed
2. Capture error details (screenshots, logs)
3. Determine if Issue #267 fix needs revision
4. Create follow-up issues if needed
5. Keep #266 open until resolved
