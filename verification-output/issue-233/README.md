## Key Findings

### Root Cause
HubSpot's Membership Profile API (`/_hcms/api/membership/v1/profile`) **only works on private pages**. On public pages, it returns 404 by design. This is a security feature, not a bug.

### Solution
Implemented JWT-based authentication system that works on both public and private pages:
- ✅ Backend: POST `/auth/login` endpoint with JWT generation
- ✅ Frontend: `window.hhIdentity.login(email)` API
- ✅ Storage: localStorage-based token management
- ✅ Security: HMAC-SHA256 signed tokens, 24h expiry
- ✅ Integration: All API endpoints support `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`

### Implementation Timeline
- **2025-10-20**: Issue #233 opened
- **2025-10-21**: Root cause identified via multi-agent investigation
- **2025-10-21**: ADR 001 documented (JWT authentication decision)

## Final Status

**Code**: ✅ Complete and merged
**Templates**: ✅ Deployed to production
**Tests**: ✅ Updated and passing locally
**Documentation**: ✅ Comprehensive guides created
**Lambda Config**: ⚠️ Pending JWT_SECRET configuration

### Next Steps

2. Verify JWT login endpoint returns valid tokens
3. Run E2E verification test
4. Capture final verification artifacts

**Estimated Time**: 15-30 minutes
