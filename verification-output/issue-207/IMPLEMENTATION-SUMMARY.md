# Issue #207 Implementation Summary

## Summary
Successfully implemented enrollment display on `/learn/my-learning` page, showing enrolled pathways and courses with metadata (enrollment date, source) and "Continue Learning" CTAs.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend JavaScript (`clean-x-hedgehog-templates/assets/js/my-learning.js`)

**New Functions Added:**
- `getEnrollmentsUrl(constants)` - Derives `/enrollments/list` endpoint URL from constants
- `formatDate(isoString)` - Formats ISO timestamps to human-readable dates (e.g., "Oct 19, 2025")
- `formatRelativeTime(isoString)` - Formats timestamps as relative times (e.g., "2 days ago")
- `renderEnrollmentCard(item, type)` - Renders individual enrollment card with metadata
- `renderEnrolledContent(enrollments)` - Renders all enrolled pathways/courses

**Modified Logic:**
- Updated main rendering flow to fetch both `/progress/read` and `/enrollments/list` in parallel
- Added error handling with friendly user messages
- Integrated enrollment display alongside existing module progress tracking

### 2. Frontend Template (`clean-x-hedgehog-templates/learn/my-learning.html`)

**New HTML Section:**
```html
<!-- Enrolled Content Section (authenticated only) -->
<section id="enrolled-section" style="display: none;">
  <div class="section-header">
    <h2>My Enrollments <span class="section-count" id="enrolled-count">(0)</span></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="enrolled-grid" id="enrolled-grid"></div>
</section>
```

**New CSS Styles:**
- `.enrolled-grid` - Grid layout for enrollment cards (responsive)
- `.enrollment-card` - Card container with hover effects
- `.enrollment-card-header` - Header with title and badge
- `.enrollment-badge` - Type indicator (pathway/course)
- `.enrollment-meta` - Metadata display (date, source)
- `.enrollment-actions` - CTA button container
- `.enrollment-cta` - Continue Learning button

### 3. Backend (No Changes Required)

The `/enrollments/list` endpoint was already implemented in Issue #206:
- Endpoint: `GET /enrollments/list?email=user@example.com`
- Returns enrolled pathways and courses with timestamps and source tracking
- Full CORS support for HubSpot CDN origins

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Enrollment Display
- Shows all enrolled pathways and courses
- Displays enrollment date in human-readable format
- Shows enrollment source (pathway_page, course_page, catalog)
- Responsive grid layout (adapts to mobile)

### ✅ User Experience
- "Continue Learning →" CTA links to pathway/course detail pages
- Visual badge distinguishes pathways from courses
- Hover effects for better interactivity
- Section hidden when no enrollments exist (graceful empty state)

### ✅ Error Handling
- Graceful fallback when API unavailable
- User-friendly error messages
- Console logging for debugging
- No breaking errors - page continues to function

### ✅ Performance
- Parallel API calls (progress + enrollments fetched simultaneously)
- Efficient DOM updates (innerHTML for batch rendering)
- No unnecessary re-renders

### ✅ Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigable links
- Screen-reader friendly labels
- High contrast colors

## Data Flow

1. **Page Load**
   - User navigates to `/learn/my-learning`
   - Template checks authentication status
   - JavaScript loads and fetches constants

2. **Authenticated User Flow**
   ```
   Fetch /progress/read → Get module progress + last viewed
   Fetch /enrollments/list → Get enrolled pathways/courses
   ↓
   Render "My Enrollments" section with cards
   Render "In Progress" modules
   Render "Completed" modules
   ```

3. **Unauthenticated User Flow**
   ```
   Fall back to localStorage for module progress
   No enrollment display (section hidden)
   ```

## API Integration

### Request
```javascript
GET /enrollments/list?email=user@example.com
```

### Response
```json
{
  "mode": "authenticated",
  "enrollments": {
    "pathways": [
      {
        "slug": "getting-started",
        "enrolled_at": "2025-10-19T12:34:56.789Z",
        "enrollment_source": "pathway_page"
      }
    ],
    "courses": [
      {
        "slug": "course-authoring-101",
        "enrolled_at": "2025-10-18T10:20:30.000Z",
        "enrollment_source": "course_page"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Rendering Logic
- Pathways → Link to `/learn/pathways/{slug}`
- Courses → Link to `/learn/courses/{slug}`
- Enrollment date formatted as "Oct 19, 2025"
- Source formatted as "pathway page" (replacing underscores)

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Authenticated User with Enrollments**
   - [ ] Log in as test user (emailmaria@hubspot.com)
   - [ ] Navigate to `/learn/my-learning`
   - [ ] Verify "My Enrollments" section appears
   - [ ] Verify enrollment cards show correct data
   - [ ] Click "Continue Learning" → lands on correct page
   - [ ] Verify responsive layout on mobile

2. **Authenticated User without Enrollments**
   - [ ] Log in as new user (no enrollments)
   - [ ] Navigate to `/learn/my-learning`
   - [ ] Verify "My Enrollments" section is hidden
   - [ ] Verify page still loads correctly

3. **Unauthenticated User**
   - [ ] Navigate to `/learn/my-learning` while logged out
   - [ ] Should redirect to login page

4. **Error Scenarios**
   - [ ] Test with CRM_PROGRESS disabled
   - [ ] Test with API endpoint unavailable
   - [ ] Verify friendly error messages display
   - [ ] Verify page doesn't break

### Integration Testing

```bash
# Set environment variables
export API_URL="https://<api-id>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
export HUBSPOT_TEST_USERNAME="emailmaria@hubspot.com"

# Test enrollments endpoint
curl -X GET "$API_URL/enrollments/list?email=$HUBSPOT_TEST_USERNAME"

# Expected: JSON response with enrollments
```
