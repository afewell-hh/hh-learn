# Issue #207 - Implementation Complete

## Summary
✅ **Successfully implemented enrollment display on My Learning dashboard**

The `/learn/my-learning` page now shows enrolled pathways and courses in a dedicated "My Enrollments" section, complete with enrollment metadata (date, source) and "Continue Learning" CTAs.

## What Was Built

### Frontend Changes

**1. Enhanced JavaScript (`my-learning.js`)**
- Integrated `/enrollments/list` API endpoint
- Added parallel data fetching (progress + enrollments)
- Implemented enrollment card rendering with metadata
- Added date formatting utilities (absolute and relative times)
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

**2. Updated Template (`my-learning.html`)**
- Added "My Enrollments" section with grid layout
- Implemented responsive CSS for enrollment cards
- Card design includes:
  - Pathway/Course title and type badge
  - Enrollment date and source
  - "Continue Learning" CTA button
  - Hover effects for better UX

### Key Features

✅ **Enrollment Display**
- Shows all enrolled pathways and courses from CRM
- Real-time data from `/enrollments/list` endpoint
- Updates within one refresh (≤5 seconds after enrollment)

✅ **Metadata Display**
- Enrollment date (human-readable: "Oct 19, 2025")
- Enrollment source (pathway_page, course_page, catalog)
- Type badge distinguishes pathways from courses

✅ **User Experience**
- "Continue Learning →" links to pathway/course detail pages
- Section hidden when no enrollments (graceful empty state)
- Responsive grid layout (adapts to mobile/tablet/desktop)

✅ **Error Handling**
- Graceful fallback when API unavailable
- User-friendly error messages
- Detailed console logging for debugging
- No breaking errors - page remains functional

✅ **Accessibility**
- Semantic HTML with proper heading hierarchy
- Keyboard navigable (all links are focusable)
- Screen-reader labels on all interactive elements
- High contrast colors (WCAG AA compliant)

## Implementation Details

### Data Flow

```
User visits /learn/my-learning (authenticated)
  ↓
JavaScript loads constants and auth context
  ↓
Parallel API calls:
  1. GET /progress/read → Module progress + last viewed
  2. GET /enrollments/list → Enrolled pathways/courses
  ↓
Render sections:
  1. "My Enrollments" (pathways and courses)
  2. "In Progress" (modules)
  3. "Completed" (modules)
```

### API Integration

**Endpoint:** `GET /enrollments/list?email=user@example.com`

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "mode": "authenticated",
  "enrollments": {
    "pathways": [
      {
        "slug": "getting-started",
        "enrolled_at": "2025-10-19T12:34:56.789Z",
        "enrollment_source": "pathway_page"
      }
    ],
    "courses": [
      {
        "slug": "course-authoring-101",
        "enrolled_at": "2025-10-18T10:20:30.000Z",
        "enrollment_source": "course_page"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Card Rendering

Each enrollment card displays:
- **Header**: Title (formatted from slug) + Type badge (PATHWAY/COURSE)
- **Metadata**: Enrollment date + Source
- **Action**: "Continue Learning →" button

Example:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Getting Started          [PATHWAY] │
│                                     │
│ Enrolled: Oct 19, 2025              │
│ Source: pathway page                │
│                                     │
│              Continue Learning →    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```
