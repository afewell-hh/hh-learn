# Documentation Index

This folder only contains long-lived references that should stay accurate as the product evolves. Anything tied to a single sprint or a historical decision belongs in GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests instead.

## Living Documents
- [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) – current system boundaries and planned evolution.
- [`content-sync.md`](content-sync.md) – operational runbook for HubSpot content syncing and related maintenance.
- [`theme-development.md`](theme-development.md) – how we extend the Clean.Pro theme safely.

When adding a new document, update this index and include an “owner” in the front matter or intro so we know who keeps it fresh.
