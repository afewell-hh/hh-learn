# Project Lead Summary - Sprint 1 Correction

**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: 🎯 Ready for Action
**Your Role**: Review and approve migration plan, assign work, perform manual HubSpot steps

---

## What Happened

You correctly identified that templates weren't appearing in HubSpot's page creation UI. After comprehensive research, I discovered we confused two separate HubSpot systems:

1. **Developer Projects** (`hs project` commands) - For apps, webhooks, API authentication
2. **CMS Themes** (`hs upload` commands) - For website templates

We used Developer Projects commands for CMS templates, so they went to the wrong place.

---

## Good News

✅ **Developer Project/App is correct** - Authentication setup works perfectly
✅ **Content is excellent** - All 3 Kubernetes modules are high quality and usable
✅ **Template logic is solid** - Just needs to be in correct structure
✅ **Easy fix** - Migration is straightforward, 4-6 hours total

## Decision Points for You

### Decision 1: Proceed with Migration?

**Recommendation**: Yes, proceed
**Rationale**:
- Clear understanding of problem
- Straightforward solution
- Most work salvageable
- Low risk (all testing in draft/preview)

**Alternative**: Start completely fresh
**Trade-off**: Would take longer, but work is good enough to salvage

**Your choice**: _________________

---

### Decision 2: Who Does the Migration?

**Option A**: Assign to coding agent (recommended)
- Uses Work Packet 1 from corrected work packets
- You perform manual HubSpot steps
- Review and approve PRs

**Option B**: You do it yourself
- Follow MIGRATION-GUIDE.md step-by-step
- Full control over process
- Faster for manual HubSpot steps

**Your choice**: _________________

---

### Decision 3: Timeline Pressure

**Question**: How urgent is content launch?

**If very urgent** (next 1-2 weeks):
- Proceed with migration immediately
- Assign Work Packet 1 today
- You do manual HubSpot steps in parallel
- Target: Migration complete by end of week

**If moderate urgency** (next month):
- Review docs thoroughly first
- Assign work packets sequentially
- More time for testing and validation
- Target: Migration complete in 1-2 weeks

**Your preference**: _________________

## What Coding Agents Need from You

Before assigning Work Packet 1:

1. **Confirmation to proceed**: "Start Work Packet 1 from docs/sprint1-work-packets-corrected.md"

2. **Emphasis on using correct commands**:
   - "Use `hs upload hedgehog-learn-theme hedgehog-learn-theme`"
   - "NOT `hs project upload`"
   - "Read docs/hubspot-architecture-correct.md first"

3. **Git workflow**:
   - Branch: `feature/cms-migration-corrected`
   - Follow work packet's commit message template
   - Create PR when done

---

## What You Need to Do Manually

These steps CANNOT be automated (HubSpot UI only):

### Manual Step 1: Activate Theme (5 minutes)
After coding agent uploads theme:
1. Go to **Settings > Website > Themes**
2. Find `hedgehog-learn-theme`
3. Click **Make active**

### Manual Step 2: Create HubDB Tables (30 minutes)
Cannot be done via CLI:
1. **Content > HubDB > Create table**
2. Create `learning_pathways` table with columns (see MIGRATION-GUIDE.md Step 7)
3. Create `learning_modules` table with columns
4. **Publish tables**
5. **Note table IDs** (in URL)
6. Provide IDs to coding agent for template update

### Manual Step 3: Create Preview Pages (30 minutes)
After templates uploaded:
1. **Content > Website Pages > Create**
2. Select `learn-landing.html` template
3. Set URL: `/learn-preview`, Status: Draft
4. Add content
5. Repeat for `module-detail.html`

### Manual Step 4: Test Preview Pages (30 minutes)
1. Open preview URLs
2. Test functionality
3. Check console for errors
4. Verify responsive design
5. Approve or request changes

**Total time for manual steps**: ~2 hours

---

## Quality Checkpoints

Before approving migration as complete:

### Checkpoint 1: Files in Correct Location
```bash
ls -la hedgehog-learn-theme/
# Should see: theme.json, templates/, css/, js/
```

### Checkpoint 2: HubSpot Design Manager
- Content > Design Manager
- Folder `hedgehog-learn-theme` visible
- All templates and CSS present

### Checkpoint 3: Templates Accessible
- Content > Website Pages > Create
- Template dropdown shows `learn-landing.html`, `module-detail.html`
- **This is the key test!**

### Checkpoint 4: Preview Pages Work
- Landing page preview renders
- Module page preview renders
- No console errors
- Responsive design works

### Checkpoint 5: Git Clean-up
- Old `src/cms/` directory removed
- New `hedgehog-learn-theme/` committed
- package.json scripts updated
- PRs properly closed/merged

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Items ✅
- File migration (copy with path updates)
- CSS migration (minor edits)
- Git operations (standard workflow)

### Medium Risk Items ⚠️
- HubDB table creation (manual, easy to mess up column names)
- Template path updates (easy to miss one)
- Theme activation (manual UI step)

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use draft pages for all testing
- Verify in Design Manager after each upload
- Keep preview URLs separate from production
- Don't publish pages until fully tested

### What Could Go Wrong?

**Scenario 1**: Templates still don't appear after migration
- **Cause**: Theme not activated or not uploaded correctly
- **Fix**: Re-upload and re-activate
- **Prevention**: Verify in Design Manager immediately after upload

**Scenario 2**: HubDB data doesn't show
- **Cause**: Wrong table IDs or unpublished tables
- **Fix**: Check table IDs, publish tables
- **Prevention**: Document table IDs clearly

**Scenario 3**: CSS doesn't load
- **Cause**: Wrong paths in templates
- **Fix**: Update require_css paths
- **Prevention**: Follow work packet path examples exactly

**Scenario 4**: Coding agent uses wrong commands again
- **Cause**: Didn't read architecture doc
- **Fix**: Point them to docs/hubspot-architecture-correct.md
- **Prevention**: Make reading it a prerequisite in work packet

---

## Success Metrics

You'll know migration succeeded when:

1. ✅ Templates appear in Content > Website Pages > Create dropdown
2. ✅ Preview pages render without errors
3. ✅ HubDB data displays on landing page
4. ✅ Syntax highlighting works on module pages
5. ✅ Responsive design works on mobile
6. ✅ No console errors in browser dev tools

**The ultimate test**: You can create a new page using the templates through HubSpot UI.

## Communication Templates

### For Coding Agent (Starting Work Packet 1)

```
I need you to execute Work Packet 1 from docs/sprint1-work-packets-corrected.md.

CRITICAL: Before starting, read docs/hubspot-architecture-correct.md completely.
We previously used the wrong HubSpot workflow and templates went to the wrong place.

Key points:
- Use `hs upload hedgehog-learn-theme hedgehog-learn-theme` (NOT hs project upload)
- Create theme in hedgehog-learn-theme/ directory (NOT src/cms/)
- Follow the work packet exactly

When done, create PR with branch name: feature/cms-migration-corrected

Let me know when you start and when you're done.
```

### For Closing PR #7

```
Closing this PR. We used the incorrect HubSpot workflow (Developer Projects instead of CMS Themes).

**Issue**: Used `hs project upload` which uploads to Developer Projects (for apps), not Design Manager (for templates). Templates aren't accessible in Content > Website Pages UI.

**Solution**: Migrating to proper CMS theme structure. See docs/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md

**Status**: Migration in progress in PR #[NEW_PR_NUMBER]

The template work was excellent - just needs to be in the correct structure.

References:
- Architecture explanation: docs/hubspot-architecture-correct.md
- Migration guide: docs/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md
- Work audit: docs/work-audit-sprint1.md
```

### For Closing PR #8

```
Closing this PR. Same issue as PR #7 - incorrect HubSpot workflow.

Migration to proper CMS theme structure in progress.

See docs/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md for details.
```

### For Merging PR #9

```
Excellent work! This content is high quality and fully usable.

The markdown content will be used to populate HubDB tables and HubSpot pages manually.

Merging!
```

## FAQ

**Q: Why can't we just move the files in HubSpot UI?**
A: Developer Projects and CMS Themes are completely separate systems. Files must be uploaded via correct CLI command to go to Design Manager.

**Q: Will this affect our existing site?**
A: No. All new pages are created as drafts with preview URLs. Production site unchanged.

**Q: Can we use the Developer Project for anything?**
A: Yes! The app we created is perfect for API authentication. AWS Lambda uses it. Keep it.

**Q: How much of the work is lost?**
A: Very little! Content is 100% usable. Templates need to be moved to correct structure with path updates (2-3 hours). CSS can be copied (30 min).

**Q: Could this happen again?**
A: No. I've documented the architecture thoroughly and added warnings in all work packets. Future agents will have correct information.

**Q: What if templates still don't appear after migration?**
A: Troubleshooting section in MIGRATION-GUIDE.md covers this. Most likely: theme not uploaded or not activated. Easy to fix.

**Q: Do we need HubSpot support?**
A: No. This is standard CMS theme workflow. We just used wrong commands before.
