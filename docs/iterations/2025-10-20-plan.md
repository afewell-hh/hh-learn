# Learn MVP Recovery Plan (Oct–Dec 2025)

This plan operationalizes Issue #181 (project owner reset), Issue #191 (agent enablement doc), and the **2025-10-18** LMS comprehensive gap analysis into four CNCF-style iterations. Each iteration runs for two weeks, closes with a review + retro, and feeds GitHub Project automation per `docs/project-management.md`.

## Guiding Inputs
- **Runbook rehydrate checklist** (Issue #181) anchoring Definition of Ready/Done.
- **Agent enablement doc** mandate (Issue #191) to unblock onboarding.
- **Gap analysis critical findings** (2025-10-18) for enrollment, progress fidelity, navigation, and data integrity.

## Iteration Timeline

| Iteration | Dates | Theme | Objectives | Exit Criteria |
|-----------|-------|-------|------------|---------------|
| I-2025-10-20 | 2025-10-20 → 2025-10-31 | Rehydrate & Enrollment MVP | Run runbook checklist, ship explicit enrollment CTAs, add Lambda enrollment tracking, surface enrolled items on My Learning, publish agent guide | Runbook checklist signed; agent doc merged; enrollment CTA flow deployed; `/events/track` storing `enrollment_source`; dashboard shows enrolled content |
| I-2025-11-03 | 2025-11-03 → 2025-11-14 | Progress Feedback & Course Context | Add button state feedback, CRM-backed pathway progress, course-aware navigation via `?from=course:{slug}`, toast/CTA confirmations | Module UI reflects state within 1s; pathway and course bars reflect CRM data; prev/next honors course sequence; QA e2e covers navigation |
| I-2025-11-17 | 2025-11-17 → 2025-11-28 | Quick Wins & Data Integrity | Enable catalog filters, add HubDB sync validation, document deletion protocol, enforce progress schema in Lambda | Filters active in production with tests; sync fails on orphaned slugs; ops doc published; Lambda rejects malformed progress payloads |
| I-2025-12-01 | 2025-12-01 → 2025-12-12 | Progress Model & Analytics | Migrate to hierarchical progress state, handle multi-course modules, emit behavioral events, stand up analytics dashboard & alarms | Migration verified in staging; multi-course scenarios pass tests; behavioral events visible in dashboard; CloudWatch alarms configured |

> Action: create these Issues in GitHub, assign iteration field, add dependencies, and attach to the **Learn MVP Launch Readiness** milestone.

## Governance & Cadence
- **Iteration kickoff** Mondays 16:00 UTC: confirm runbook checklist, review capacity, assign owners.
- **Daily sync** (async in GitHub Project comments) to flag blockers; use `blocked` label when necessary.
- **Review/retro** final Friday of each iteration: attach outcomes, metrics, and verification artifacts to the milestone.
- **Evidence storage:** deposit logs, curl outputs, and screenshots under `verification-output/issue-###/`.
- **Definition of Done:** code merged, HubSpot assets published via `publish-template`, Lambda deployed, docs updated, verification artifacts stored.

## Success Metrics
- Enrollment CTA conversion (click-through vs. page views) ≥ 40% for pilot cohort by 2025-11-15.
- 100% of pathway/course pages display CRM-derived progress bars by 2025-11-14.
- HubDB sync pipeline runs without orphan warnings for two consecutive weeks post-2025-11-28.
- Behavioral events visible in dashboard within 5 minutes of trigger by 2025-12-12.

## Dependencies & Risks
- Requires stable `HUBSPOT_PROJECT_ACCESS_TOKEN`; regenerate per Issue #181 if scopes change.
- Lambda deploys depend on Serverless CI; ensure workflow_dispatch fix (#194) is merged before iteration 1 deploys.
- Multi-course module handling may require authoring schema updates; coordinate with Content Ops before migration.

## Next Steps
1. Spin up the **Learn MVP Launch Readiness** milestone and add the four iteration time boxes as Project iterations.
2. Create the backlog issues above with linked dependencies and milestone assignments.
3. Draft owners for iteration 1 tasks and schedule kick-off meeting notes in `docs/iterations/`.
