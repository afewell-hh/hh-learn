# Repository Cleanup Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Purpose**: Remove all outdated and confusing content before migration

---

## Files/Directories Removed

### 1. `src/cms/` (ENTIRE DIRECTORY)
**Why removed**: Wrong structure and location
- Used Developer Project approach (incorrect)
- Should be separate theme directory: `hedgehog-learn-theme/`
- Templates not accessible in HubSpot UI from this location
- All content will be migrated to proper structure

**What was in it**:
- `src/cms/templates/` - Template files (will migrate to new theme)
- `src/cms/css/` - CSS files (will migrate)
- `src/cms/modules/` - Module definitions
- `src/cms/theme.json` - Theme config

### 2. `docs/cms-development.md`
**Why removed**: Contains incorrect workflow instructions
- Instructs to use `npm run cms:upload` which runs `hs project upload` ❌
- Should use `hs upload hedgehog-learn-theme hedgehog-learn-theme` ✅
- References wrong directory structure (`src/cms/`)
- Would confuse future agents

**Replaced by**:
- `docs/hubspot-architecture-correct.md` (architecture)
- `docs/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md` (correct workflow)

### 3. `docs/sprint1-work-packets.md`
**Why removed**: OLD version with incorrect instructions
- All work packets reference wrong commands
- Work Packet #1 creates `src/cms/` structure (wrong)
- npm scripts use `hs project` commands (wrong for CMS)

**Replaced by**: `docs/sprint1-work-packets-corrected.md`

### 4. `docs/preview-workflow.md`
**Why removed**: References wrong template locations
- Mentions templates in `learn/landing.html` (incomplete path)
- Assumes templates uploaded via old workflow
- Preview process will be different with correct theme structure

**Note**: Preview workflow will be documented in corrected work packets

### 5. `hs/hsproject.json`
**Why removed**: Different format, not the canonical one
- Root `hsproject.json` is the correct one
- This one has different structure
- Causes confusion about which is authoritative

### 6. `hs/` directory
**Why removed**: Now empty after removing hsproject.json

### 7. `scratch.txt`
**Why removed**: Empty temporary file

---

## Files Updated

### `package.json`
**Changed**: Removed incorrect CMS npm scripts

**Removed**:
```json
"cms:watch": "hs project dev",
"cms:upload": "hs project upload",
"cms:fetch": "hs project fetch"
```

**Why**: These commands are for Developer Projects, not CMS Themes

**Will be replaced with** (during migration):
```json
"theme:upload": "hs upload hedgehog-learn-theme hedgehog-learn-theme",
"theme:watch": "hs watch hedgehog-learn-theme hedgehog-learn-theme",
"theme:fetch": "hs fetch hedgehog-learn-theme hedgehog-learn-theme"
```

---

## Files Kept (Verified Clean)

### ✅ Core Project Files
- `hsproject.json` (root) - Correct Developer Project config
- `package.json` - Updated, now clean

- `docs/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step migration
- `docs/PROJECT-LEAD-SUMMARY.md` - Summary for project lead

### ✅ Valid Documentation (Still Accurate)
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` - Project roadmap and phases
- `docs/architecture.md` - High-level architecture (short, still valid)
- `docs/adr-20251005-authentication-integration.md` - Auth decision
- `docs/adr-20251005-hubspot-aws-integration.md` - Integration decision

### ✅ Content (Excellent Quality)
- `content/modules/intro-to-kubernetes/` - Complete module ✅
- `content/modules/kubernetes-storage/` - Complete module ✅
- `content/modules/kubernetes-networking/` - Complete module ✅

### ✅ Infrastructure
- `src/app/app-hsmeta.json` - Developer Project app config (correct!)
- `src/api/lambda/` - Lambda function skeletons
- `src/shared/` - Shared TypeScript utilities
- `src/sync/` - HubDB sync scripts
- `hubdb-schemas/` - HubDB table schemas
- `tests/` - Test directory structure

## Impact Assessment

### What This Cleanup Achieves

1. **Removes confusion** - No more incorrect workflow instructions
2. **Clear path forward** - Only corrected docs remain
3. **Prevents mistakes** - Future agents won't use wrong commands
4. **Preserves good work** - All usable content kept
5. **Clean foundation** - Ready for proper migration

### What Still Needs to Be Done

From this clean state, follow:
1. `docs/PROJECT-LEAD-SUMMARY.md` - Start here
2. `docs/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md` - Migration steps
3. `docs/sprint1-work-packets-corrected.md` - Work for coding agents
