# Hedgehog Learn — Early Alpha Executive Summary

Version: v0.2.0‑alpha.0  
Date: 2025‑10‑14  
Commit: 5e91926d9c73

**Positioning**
- Learn, Courses, and Pathways are live on production and rendering correctly.
- “Course Authoring 101” is complete and deduplicated (modules rendered once via `content_blocks_json`).
- `?debug=1` banners surface resolved HubDB table IDs for fast diagnostics.

**Key Metrics**
- Total lines of implementation and docs: ~5,503
  - Templates (HubL/HTML): ~3,020
  - Scripts/CLI (TypeScript): ~995
  - App `src/` (TypeScript): ~1,108
  - Documentation (Markdown): ~380
- Live modules with full content: 11
  - accessing-the-hedgehog-virtual-lab-with-amazon-web-services, accessing-the-hedgehog-virtual-lab-with-google-cloud, accessing-the-hedgehog-virtual-lab-with-microsoft-azure, authoring-assembly-courses, intro-to-kubernetes, kubernetes-networking, kubernetes-storage, authoring-basics, authoring-media-and-metadata, authoring-pathways-and-content-blocks, authoring-qa-and-troubleshooting
- Published site pages: 4 — `/learn`, `/learn/courses`, `/learn/pathways`, `/learn/my-learning`
- Issues closed to date: 30 (e.g., #118–#122, #123–#124, #126, #107)

**Notable Deliverables**
- Robust templates using fetch‑once HubDB strategy with normalized key matching; per‑slug fallbacks as needed.
- constants.json updated/published; resilient template fallbacks avoid cache‑related regressions.
- Course Authoring track delivered (Authoring Basics, Media & Metadata, QA & Troubleshooting) with supporting docs:
  - Content Standard and Contributor Guide integrated into issue templates.
- Operational automation: upload/publish scripts and Playwright screenshot tooling.

**Demo Links** (append `?debug=1` for diagnostics)
- Learn: https://hedgehog.cloud/learn
- Courses: https://hedgehog.cloud/learn/courses
- Pathways: https://hedgehog.cloud/learn/pathways
- Course Authoring 101: https://hedgehog.cloud/learn/courses/course-authoring-101

**Known Gaps (Tracked)**
- Top‑of‑page list debug banners may briefly lag due to HubSpot caching; section banners and detail pages show correct IDs (#113, #114, #127).
- Historic PRs (#103, #99) conflict with `main`; behavior already implemented on `main` (cleanup in #111).

**What’s Next**
- Verify list‑page banner parity as cache rotates; attach final screenshots and close #127.
- Scale content using the new Standard + Guide; plan the next slice of modules/courses.
- Evaluate HubDB “settings” table or short‑TTL endpoint for constants (#117) to eliminate asset caching dependence.
