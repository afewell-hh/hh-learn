# Hedgehog Learn – Early Alpha Executive Summary (v0.2.0‑alpha.0)

Date: 2025-10-14  
Tag: `v0.2.0-alpha.0`  
Commit: 5e91926d9c73

## Snapshot
- Learn, Courses, and Pathways templates are live and rendering correctly in production.
- Course Authoring 101 is complete and deduplicated (modules appear once via `content_blocks_json`).
- Debug banners (`?debug=1`) print resolved HubDB table IDs to speed diagnostics.

## Key Metrics
- Total lines (templates + scripts + src + docs): ~5,503
  - Templates (HubL/HTML): ~3,020
  - Scripts/CLI (TypeScript): ~995
  - App `src/` (TypeScript): ~1,108
  - Documentation (Markdown): ~380
- Live modules with full content: 11
  - Slugs: accessing-the-hedgehog-virtual-lab-with-amazon-web-services, accessing-the-hedgehog-virtual-lab-with-google-cloud, accessing-the-hedgehog-virtual-lab-with-microsoft-azure, authoring-assembly-courses, intro-to-kubernetes, kubernetes-networking, kubernetes-storage, authoring-basics, authoring-media-and-metadata, authoring-pathways-and-content-blocks, authoring-qa-and-troubleshooting
- Published site pages: 4  
  `/learn`, `/learn/courses`, `/learn/pathways`, `/learn/my-learning`
- Closed issues to date: 30 (including 118–122, 123–124, 126, 107)

## What’s In This Alpha
- Robust templates with fetch‑once HubDB strategy, normalized key matching, and on‑page diagnostics.
- Constants hardened: `HUBDB_*_TABLE_ID` available via constants.json with template fallbacks to avoid caching gaps.
- Course Authoring 101 track (3 authoring modules) plus supporting authoring docs:
  - Content Standard and Contributor Guide wired into the repo and issue templates.
- Operational scripts for publishing and verification (upload/publish/diagnostics + Playwright screenshots).

## Demo Links (add `?debug=1`)
- Learn: https://hedgehog.cloud/learn
- Courses: https://hedgehog.cloud/learn/courses
- Pathways: https://hedgehog.cloud/learn/pathways
- Course Authoring 101: https://hedgehog.cloud/learn/courses/course-authoring-101

## Known Gaps (Tracked)
- Top‑of‑page list debug banners may briefly lag due to HubSpot caching; the templates compute and use the correct IDs and section banners confirm them. See #113, #114, #127.
- Two historical PRs (#103, #99) have conflicts; behavior is already implemented on `main`. Cleanup tracked in #111.

## Next Steps (Proposed)
- Finalize banner parity across list/detail after cache fully rotates.
- Content program: continue scaling modules using the new Standard + Guide.
- Optional: Convert constants delivery to HubDB “settings” table or short‑TTL endpoint (see #117) for instant propagation.
