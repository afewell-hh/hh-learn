  "summary_markdown": "Transform your approach to network operations with Hedgehog's Kubernetes-native fabric platform. This comprehensive pathway teaches you to provision, monitor, and troubleshoot modern datacenter networks using the same declarative infrastructure-as-code principles that power the world's largest hyperscalers.\n\nWhether you're a cloud-native engineer learning networking or a traditional network engineer adopting Kubernetes, this pathway bridges both worldsâ€”building confidence through hands-on labs, systematic workflows, and real-world operational scenarios. By the end, you'll operate Hedgehog fabrics with the same confidence you have managing Kubernetes workloads.",
