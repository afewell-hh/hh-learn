 * Auth UI Toggle Styles (Issue #284)

 * Hides authentication-dependent UI when ENABLE_AUTH_UI is false in constants.json.
 * This allows the site to launch with all auth features hidden while keeping the
 * code intact for easy re-enablement when SSO is ready.
 *
 * Usage: Add class="hhl-auth-gated" to any element that should be hidden when auth is disabled.
