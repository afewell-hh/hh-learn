# How to Start the Coding Agent for Work Packet 1

**Quick Start**: Copy the message below and start a new coding agent session.

---

## Message for Coding Agent

```
I need you to execute Work Packet 1 for the Hedgehog Learn project.

CRITICAL - Read these files FIRST (in this order):
1. docs/hubspot-architecture-correct.md - Understand HubSpot 2025.2 architecture
2. docs/CODING-AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md - Your specific instructions
3. docs/sprint1-work-packets-corrected.md - Work Packet 1 details

Task: Execute Work Packet 1 - Create HubSpot CMS theme structure

Key points:
- Use "hs create website-theme hedgehog-learn-theme" to create theme
- Upload with "hs upload hedgehog-learn-theme hedgehog-learn-theme"
- DO NOT use "hs project upload" (that's for Developer Projects, not themes)
- Create theme in hedgehog-learn-theme/ directory (NOT src/cms/)
- Follow Work Packet 1 in docs/sprint1-work-packets-corrected.md exactly

When done:
- Create PR with branch: feature/cms-theme-setup
- Verify theme appears in HubSpot Design Manager
- Comment in PR that Work Packet 1 is complete

Repository: /home/ubuntu/afewell-hh/hedgehog-learn
HubSpot Account ID: 21430285

Please confirm you've read the architecture doc before starting.
```

## What You'll Do After

Once the coding agent's PR is merged, you'll need to do these manual steps in HubSpot UI:

### 1. Create HubDB Tables (30 min)
- Content > HubDB
- Create "learning_pathways" table
- Create "learning_modules" table
- See: docs/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md Step 7

### 2. Activate Theme (5 min)
- Settings > Website > Themes
- Activate "hedgehog-learn-theme"
- See: docs/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md Step 8

### 3. Create Preview Pages (30 min)
- Content > Website Pages
- Create landing page preview
- Create module page preview
- See: docs/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md Step 9

### 4. Populate HubDB (30 min)
- Add module data to HubDB tables
- Publish tables
- See: docs/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md Step 10

**Your total time**: ~2 hours (after agent completes)

## Monitoring the Coding Agent

While the agent works, watch for:
- ‚úÖ Agent reads docs/hubspot-architecture-correct.md first
- ‚úÖ Agent uses `hs upload` (not `hs project upload`)
- ‚úÖ Agent creates `hedgehog-learn-theme/` directory (not `src/cms/`)
- ‚úÖ Agent verifies upload in HubSpot Design Manager
- ‚úÖ Agent creates PR with proper branch name

If you see any of these ‚ùå:
- Using `hs project upload`
- Creating `src/cms/` directory
- Not reading architecture doc first
- Adding `cms:*` scripts to package.json

Stop the agent and redirect to docs/CODING-AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md

---

## After Agent Completes

1. **Review the PR**
2. **Check HubSpot Design Manager** - verify theme uploaded
3. **Merge the PR** if everything looks good
4. **Start your manual steps** (HubDB tables, etc.)

---

## Timeline

**Today**:
- Coding agent executes Work Packet 1 (~2 hours)
- You review and merge PR (~15 min)

**Next**:
- You do manual HubSpot steps (~2 hours)
- Or assign Work Packet 2 to coding agent (templates)

**End result**: Working theme with preview pages ready to test!
